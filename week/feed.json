Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)\n\n##### Domain Specific Language / Imperative DSL Applications\n\n*   [Infinigen Indoors: Photorealistic Indoor Scenes using Procedural Generation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Raistrick_Infinigen_Indoors_Photorealistic_Indoor_Scenes_using_Procedural_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.html) - ***CVPR'24***, 2024. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14526967027465419958)]. This work introduces Infinigen Indoors, a Blender-based procedural generator of photorealistic indoor scenes. It builds upon the existing Infinigen system, which focuses on natural scenes, but expands its coverage to indoor scenes by introducing a diverse library of procedural indoor assets, including furniture, architecture elements, appliances, and other day-to-day objects. It also introduces a constraint-based arrangement system, which consists of a domain-specific language for expressing diverse constraints on scene composition, and a solver that generates scene compositions that maximally satisfy the constraints. The authors provide an export tool that allows the generated 3D objects and scenes to be directly used for training embodied agents in real-time simulators such as Omniverse and Unreal. Infinigen Indoors is open-sourced under the BSD license.\n\n##### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications\n\n*   [Configurable 3D Scene Synthesis and 2D Image Rendering with Per-pixel Ground Truth Using Stochastic Grammars](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-018-1103-5) - ***International Journal of Computer Vision***, 2018. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8301697457354598778)]. \\[[Preprint](https://yzhu.io/publication/scenesynthesis2018ijcv/paper.pdf)]. This work proposes a systematic learning-based approach to the generation of massive quantities of synthetic 3D scenes and arbitrary numbers of photorealistic 2D images thereof, with associated ground truth information, for the purposes of training, benchmarking, and diagnosing learning-based computer vision and robotics algorithms. In particular, the authors devise a learning-based pipeline of algorithms capable of automatically generating and rendering a potentially infinite variety of indoor scenes by using a stochastic grammar, represented as an attributed Spatial And-Or Graph, in conjunction with state-of-the-art physics-based rendering. The pipeline is capable of synthesizing scene layouts with high diversity, and it is configurable inasmuch as it enables the precise customization and control of important attributes of the generated scenes. It renders photorealistic RGB images of the generated scenes while automatically synthesizing detailed, per-pixel ground truth data, including visible surface depth and normal, object identity, and material information (detailed to object parts), as well as environments (e.g., illuminations and camera viewpoints). The authors demonstrate the value of the synthesized dataset, by improving performance in certain machine-learning-based scene understanding tasks—depth and surface normal prediction, semantic segmentation, reconstruction, etc.---and by providing benchmarks for and diagnostics of trained models by modifying object attributes and scene properties in a controllable manner.\n\n##### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis\n\n*   [Mathematical discoveries from program search with large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6) - ***Nature***, 2024. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5653439474813913484)]. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous capabilities in solving complex tasks, from quantitative reasoning to understanding natural language. However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. This work introduces FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics—the cap set problem—we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. The authors showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.\n\n##### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations\n\n*   [How laypeople evaluate scientific explanations containing jargon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02227-0) - ***Nature Human Behavior***, 2025. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6467855047925175367)]. Individuals rely on others’ expertise to achieve a basic understanding of the world. But how can non-experts achieve understanding from explanations that, by definition, they are ill-equipped to assess? Across 9 experiments with 6,698 participants (Study 1A = 737; 1B = 734; 1C = 733; 2A = 1,014; 2B = 509; 2C = 1,012; 3A = 1,026; 3B = 512; 4 = 421), this work addresses this puzzle by focusing on scientific explanations with jargon. The authors identify ‘when’ and ‘why’ the inclusion of jargon makes explanations more satisfying, despite decreasing their comprehensibility. The authors find that jargon increases satisfaction because laypeople assume the jargon fills gaps in explanations that are otherwise incomplete. The authors also identify strategies for debiasing these judgements: when people attempt to generate their own explanations, inflated judgements of poor explanations with jargon are reduced, and people become better calibrated in their assessments of their own ability to explain.\n\n##### Explainability / Trustworthy AI\n\n*   [Explaining machine learning models with interactive natural language conversations using TalkToModel](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00692-8) - ***Nature Machine Intelligence***, 2023. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7044008493489695982)]. Practitioners increasingly use machine learning (ML) models, yet models have become more complex and harder to understand. To understand complex models, researchers have proposed techniques to explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use explainability methods because they do not know which explanation to choose and how to interpret the explanation. This work addresses the challenge of using explainability methods by proposing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system that explains ML models through natural language conversations. TalkToModel consists of three components: an adaptive dialogue engine that interprets natural language and generates meaningful responses; an execution component that constructs the explanations used in the conversation; and a conversational interface. In real-world evaluations, 73% of healthcare workers agreed they would use TalkToModel over existing systems for understanding a disease prediction model, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel was easier to use, demonstrating that TalkToModel is highly effective for model explainability.\n\n#### [26.

[<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14526967027465419958\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. This work introduces Infinigen Indoors, a Blender-based procedural generator of photorealistic indoor scenes. It builds upon the existing Infinigen system, which focuses on natural scenes, but expands its coverage to indoor scenes by introducing a diverse library of procedural indoor assets, including furniture, architecture elements, appliances, and other day-to-day objects. It also introduces a constraint-based arrangement system, which consists of a domain-specific language for expressing diverse constraints on scene composition, and a solver that generates scene compositions that maximally satisfy the constraints. The authors provide an export tool that allows the generated 3D objects and scenes to be directly used for training embodied agents in real-time simulators such as Omniverse and Unreal. Infinigen Indoors is open-sourced under the BSD license.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-018-1103-5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Configurable 3D Scene Synthesis and 2D Image Rendering with Per-pixel Ground Truth Using Stochastic Grammars</a> - <em><strong>International Journal of Computer Vision</strong></em>, 2018.

[<a href=\"https://yzhu.io/publication/scenesynthesis2018ijcv/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preprint</a>]. This work proposes a systematic learning-based approach to the generation of massive quantities of synthetic 3D scenes and arbitrary numbers of photorealistic 2D images thereof, with associated ground truth information, for the purposes of training, benchmarking, and diagnosing learning-based computer vision and robotics algorithms. In particular, the authors devise a learning-based pipeline of algorithms capable of automatically generating and rendering a potentially infinite variety of indoor scenes by using a stochastic grammar, represented as an attributed Spatial And-Or Graph, in conjunction with state-of-the-art physics-based rendering. The pipeline is capable of synthesizing scene layouts with high diversity, and it is configurable inasmuch as it enables the precise customization and control of important attributes of the generated scenes. It renders photorealistic RGB images of the generated scenes while automatically synthesizing detailed, per-pixel ground truth data, including visible surface depth and normal, object identity, and material information (detailed to object parts), as well as environments (e.g., illuminations and camera viewpoints). The authors demonstrate the value of the synthesized dataset, by improving performance in certain machine-learning-based scene understanding tasks—depth and surface normal prediction, semantic segmentation, reconstruction, etc.---and by providing benchmarks for and diagnostics of trained models by modifying object attributes and scene properties in a controllable manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mathematical discoveries from program search with large language models</a> - <em><strong>Nature</strong></em>, 2024. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5653439474813913484\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous capabilities in solving complex tasks, from quantitative reasoning to understanding natural language. However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. This work introduces FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics—the cap set problem—we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. The authors showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02227-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How laypeople evaluate scientific explanations containing jargon</a> - <em><strong>Nature Human Behavior</strong></em>, 2025. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6467855047925175367\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. Individuals rely on others’ expertise to achieve a basic understanding of the world. But how can non-experts achieve understanding from explanations that, by definition, they are ill-equipped to assess? Across 9 experiments with 6,698 participants (Study 1A = 737; 1B = 734; 1C = 733; 2A = 1,014; 2B = 509; 2C = 1,012; 3A = 1,026; 3B = 512; 4 = 421), this work addresses this puzzle by focusing on scientific explanations with jargon. The authors identify ‘when’ and ‘why’ the inclusion of jargon makes explanations more satisfying, despite decreasing their comprehensibility. The authors find that jargon increases satisfaction because laypeople assume the jargon fills gaps in explanations that are otherwise incomplete. The authors also identify strategies for debiasing these judgements: when people attempt to generate their own explanations, inflated judgements of poor explanations with jargon are reduced, and people become better calibrated in their assessments of their own ability to explain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Explainability / Trustworthy AI</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00692-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Explaining machine learning models with interactive natural language conversations using TalkToModel</a> - <em><strong>Nature Machine Intelligence</strong></em>, 2023. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7044008493489695982\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. Practitioners increasingly use machine learning (ML) models, yet models have become more complex and harder to understand. To understand complex models, researchers have proposed techniques to explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use explainability methods because they do not know which explanation to choose and how to interpret the explanation. This work addresses the challenge of using explainability methods by proposing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system that explains ML models through natural language conversations. TalkToModel consists of three components: an adaptive dialogue engine that interprets natural language and generates meaningful responses; an execution component that constructs the explanations used in the conversation; and a conversational interface. In real-world evaluations, 73% of healthcare workers agreed they would use TalkToModel over existing systems for understanding a disease prediction model, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel was easier to use, demonstrating that TalkToModel is highly effective for model explainability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"/ddotta/awesome-polars/\">26.

Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)\n\n##### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications\n\n*   [Meta-analysis of the functional neuroimaging literature with probabilistic logic programming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21801-4) - ***Scientific Reports***, 2022. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5952076495542489316)]. Inferring reliable brain-behavior associations requires synthesizing evidence from thousands of functional neuroimaging studies through meta-analysis. However, existing meta-analysis tools are limited to investigating simple neuroscience concepts and expressing a restricted range of questions. This work expands the scope of neuroimaging meta-analysis by designing NeuroLang: a domain-specific language to express and test hypotheses using probabilistic first-order logic programming. By leveraging formalisms found at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation, NeuroLang provides the expressivity to address a larger repertoire of hypotheses in a meta-analysis, while seamlessly modeling the uncertainty inherent to neuroimaging data. The authors demonstrate the language’s capabilities in conducting comprehensive neuroimaging meta-analysis through use-case examples that address questions of structure-function associations. Specifically, the authors infer the specific functional roles of three canonical brain networks, support the role of the visual word-form area in visuospatial attention, and investigate the heterogeneous organization of the frontoparietal control network.\n\n##### Problem Solving / Human-Level Problem Solving\n\n*   [Beyond imitation: Zero-shot task transfer on robots by learning concepts as cognitive programs](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.aav3150) - ***Science Robotics***, 2019. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7451223471302689228)]. Humans can infer concepts from image pairs and apply those in the physical world in a completely different setting, enabling tasks like IKEA assembly from diagrams. If robots could represent and infer high-level concepts, then it would notably improve their ability to understand our intent and to transfer tasks between different environments. To that end, the authors introduce a computational framework that replicates aspects of human concept learning. Concepts are represented as programs on a computer architecture consisting of a visual perception system, working memory, and action controller. The instruction set of this cognitive computer has commands for parsing a visual scene, directing gaze and attention, imagining new objects, manipulating the contents of a visual working memory, and controlling arm movement. Inferring a concept corresponds to inducing a program that can transform the input to the output. Some concepts require the use of imagination and recursion. Previously learned concepts simplify the learning of subsequent, more elaborate concepts and create a hierarchy of abstractions. The authors demonstrate how a robot can use these abstractions to interpret novel concepts presented to it as schematic images and then apply those concepts in very different situations. By bringing cognitive science ideas on mental imagery, perceptual symbols, embodied cognition, and deictic mechanisms into the realm of machine learning, this work brings researchers closer to the goal of building robots that have interpretable representations and common sense.\n\n##### Explainability / Trustworthy AI\n\n*   [A tale of two explanations: Enhancing human trust by explaining robot behavior](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aay4663) - ***Science Robotics***, 2019. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3985046411399524590)]. \\[[Preprint](https://yzhu.io/publication/openbottle2019scirob/paper.pdf)]. The ability to provide comprehensive explanations of chosen actions is a hallmark of intelligence. Lack of this ability impedes the general acceptance of AI and robot systems in critical tasks. This paper examines what forms of explanations best foster human trust in machines and proposes a framework in which explanations are generated from both functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstrations to open medicine bottles using (i) an embodied haptic prediction model to extract knowledge from sensory feedback, (ii) a stochastic grammar model induced to capture the compositional structure of a multistep task, and (iii) an improved Earley parsing algorithm to jointly leverage both the haptic and grammar models. The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles. Using different forms of explanations generated by the robot system, we conducted a psychological experiment to examine what forms of explanations best foster human trust in the robot. The authors found that comprehensive and real-time visualizations of the robot’s internal decisions were more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text descriptions. In addition, forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to the model components contributing to the best task performance. This divergence shows a need for the robotics community to integrate model components to enhance both task execution and human trust in machines.\n\n##### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research\n\n*   [Design of metalloproteins and novel protein folds using variational autoencoders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34533-1) - ***Scientific Reports***, 2018. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18126187509308242959)]. The design of novel proteins has many applications but remains an attritional process with success in isolated cases. Meanwhile, deep learning technologies have exploded in popularity in recent years and are increasingly applicable to biology due to the rise in available data. This work attempts to link protein design and deep learning by using variational autoencoders to generate protein sequences conditioned on desired properties. Potential copper and calcium binding sites are added to non-metal binding proteins without human intervention and compared to a hidden Markov model. In another use case, a grammar of protein structures is developed and used to produce sequences for a novel protein topology. One candidate structure is found to be stable by molecular dynamics simulation. The ability of the model to confine the vast search space of protein sequences and to scale easily has the potential to assist in a variety of protein design tasks.\n\n#### [27.

[<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5952076495542489316\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. Inferring reliable brain-behavior associations requires synthesizing evidence from thousands of functional neuroimaging studies through meta-analysis. However, existing meta-analysis tools are limited to investigating simple neuroscience concepts and expressing a restricted range of questions. This work expands the scope of neuroimaging meta-analysis by designing NeuroLang: a domain-specific language to express and test hypotheses using probabilistic first-order logic programming. By leveraging formalisms found at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation, NeuroLang provides the expressivity to address a larger repertoire of hypotheses in a meta-analysis, while seamlessly modeling the uncertainty inherent to neuroimaging data. The authors demonstrate the language’s capabilities in conducting comprehensive neuroimaging meta-analysis through use-case examples that address questions of structure-function associations. Specifically, the authors infer the specific functional roles of three canonical brain networks, support the role of the visual word-form area in visuospatial attention, and investigate the heterogeneous organization of the frontoparietal control network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Problem Solving / Human-Level Problem Solving</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.aav3150\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beyond imitation: Zero-shot task transfer on robots by learning concepts as cognitive programs</a> - <em><strong>Science Robotics</strong></em>, 2019. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7451223471302689228\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. Humans can infer concepts from image pairs and apply those in the physical world in a completely different setting, enabling tasks like IKEA assembly from diagrams. If robots could represent and infer high-level concepts, then it would notably improve their ability to understand our intent and to transfer tasks between different environments. To that end, the authors introduce a computational framework that replicates aspects of human concept learning. Concepts are represented as programs on a computer architecture consisting of a visual perception system, working memory, and action controller. The instruction set of this cognitive computer has commands for parsing a visual scene, directing gaze and attention, imagining new objects, manipulating the contents of a visual working memory, and controlling arm movement. Inferring a concept corresponds to inducing a program that can transform the input to the output. Some concepts require the use of imagination and recursion. Previously learned concepts simplify the learning of subsequent, more elaborate concepts and create a hierarchy of abstractions. The authors demonstrate how a robot can use these abstractions to interpret novel concepts presented to it as schematic images and then apply those concepts in very different situations. By bringing cognitive science ideas on mental imagery, perceptual symbols, embodied cognition, and deictic mechanisms into the realm of machine learning, this work brings researchers closer to the goal of building robots that have interpretable representations and common sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Explainability / Trustworthy AI</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aay4663\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A tale of two explanations: Enhancing human trust by explaining robot behavior</a> - <em><strong>Science Robotics</strong></em>, 2019. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3985046411399524590\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. [<a href=\"https://yzhu.io/publication/openbottle2019scirob/paper.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preprint</a>]. The ability to provide comprehensive explanations of chosen actions is a hallmark of intelligence. Lack of this ability impedes the general acceptance of AI and robot systems in critical tasks. This paper examines what forms of explanations best foster human trust in machines and proposes a framework in which explanations are generated from both functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstrations to open medicine bottles using (i) an embodied haptic prediction model to extract knowledge from sensory feedback, (ii) a stochastic grammar model induced to capture the compositional structure of a multistep task, and (iii) an improved Earley parsing algorithm to jointly leverage both the haptic and grammar models. The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles. Using different forms of explanations generated by the robot system, we conducted a psychological experiment to examine what forms of explanations best foster human trust in the robot. The authors found that comprehensive and real-time visualizations of the robot’s internal decisions were more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text descriptions. In addition, forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to the model components contributing to the best task performance. This divergence shows a need for the robotics community to integrate model components to enhance both task execution and human trust in machines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Science Logology / AI Assisted Research</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34533-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design of metalloproteins and novel protein folds using variational autoencoders</a> - <em><strong>Scientific Reports</strong></em>, 2018. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18126187509308242959\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. The design of novel proteins has many applications but remains an attritional process with success in isolated cases. Meanwhile, deep learning technologies have exploded in popularity in recent years and are increasingly applicable to biology due to the rise in available data. This work attempts to link protein design and deep learning by using variational autoencoders to generate protein sequences conditioned on desired properties. Potential copper and calcium binding sites are added to non-metal binding proteins without human intervention and compared to a hidden Markov model. In another use case, a grammar of protein structures is developed and used to produce sequences for a novel protein topology. One candidate structure is found to be stable by molecular dynamics simulation. The ability of the model to confine the vast search space of protein sequences and to scale easily has the potential to assist in a variety of protein design tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"/ddotta/awesome-polars/\">27.

Large language models can produce creative and diverse responses. However, to integrate them into current developer workflows, it is essential to constrain their outputs to follow specific formats or standards. This work surveyed 51 experienced industry professionals to understand the range of scenarios and motivations driving the need for output constraints from a user-centered perspective. The authors identified 134 concrete use cases for constraints at two levels: low-level, which ensures the output adhere to a structured format and an appropriate length, and high-level, which requires the output to follow semantic and stylistic guidelines without hallucination. Critically, applying output constraints could not only streamline the currently repetitive process of developing, testing, and integrating LLM prompts for developers, but also enhance the user experience of LLM-powered features and applications. The authors conclude with a discussion on user preferences and needs towards articulating intended constraints for LLMs, alongside an initial design for a constraint prototyping tool.\n\n##### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications\n\n*   [Artificial intelligence driven design of catalysts and materials for ring opening polymerization using a domain-specific language](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39396-3) - ***Nature Communications***, 2023. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6595955912508683146)]. \\[[Project (⭐14)](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-materials-notebook)]. Advances in machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation are poised to vastly accelerate research in polymer science. Data representation is a critical aspect for enabling ML integration in research workflows, yet many data models impose significant rigidity making it difficult to accommodate a broad array of experiment and data types found in polymer science. This inflexibility presents a significant barrier for researchers to leverage their historical data in ML development. This work shows that a domain specific language, termed Chemical Markdown Language (CMDL), provides flexible, extensible, and consistent representation of disparate experiment types and polymer structures. CMDL enables seamless use of historical experimental data to fine-tune regression transformer (RT) models for generative molecular design tasks. The authors demonstrate the utility of this approach through the generation and the experimental validation of catalysts and polymers in the context of ring-opening polymerization---although the authors provide examples of how CMDL can be more broadly applied to other polymer classes. Critically, this work shows how the CMDL tuned model preserves key functional groups within the polymer structure, allowing for experimental validation. These results reveal the versatility of CMDL and how it facilitates translation of historical data into meaningful predictive and generative models to produce experimentally actionable output.\n\n##### Problem Solving / Planning\n\n*   [Integrated Task and Motion Planning](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-control-091420-084139) - ***Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems***, 2021. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=478421650694199529)]. The problem of planning for a robot that operates in environments containing a large number of objects, taking actions to move itself through the world as well as to change the state of the objects, is known as task and motion planning (TAMP). TAMP problems contain elements of discrete task planning, discrete–continuous mathematical programming, and continuous motion planning and thus cannot be effectively addressed by any of these fields directly. In this article, the authors define a class of TAMP problems and survey algorithms for solving them, characterizing the solution methods in terms of their strategies for solving the continuous-space subproblems and their techniques for integrating the discrete and continuous components of the search.\n\n##### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research\n\n*   [Machine learning-assisted molecular design and efficiency prediction for high-performance organic photovoltaic materials](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aay4275) - ***Science Advances***, 2019. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12392230644945701722)]. In the process of finding high-performance materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is meaningful if one can establish the relationship between chemical structures and photovoltaic properties even before synthesizing them. This work first establishes a database containing over 1700 donor materials reported in the literature. Through supervised learning, our machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure-property relationship and, thus, implement fast screening of OPV materials. The authors explore several expressions for molecule structures, i.e., images, ASCII strings, descriptors, and fingerprints, as inputs for various ML algorithms. It is found that fingerprints with length over 1000 bits can obtain high prediction accuracy. The reliability of the approach is further verified by screening 10 newly designed donor materials. Good consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that ML is a powerful tool to prescreen new OPV materials, thus accelerating the development of the OPV field.\n*   [BioPlanner: Automatic Evaluation of LLMs on Protocol Planning in Biology](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.162/) - ***EMNLP'23***, 2023. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1222312709622462659)]. \\[[Project (⭐25)](https://github.com/bioplanner/bioplanner)].

[<a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/we-need-structured-output-towards-user-centered-constraints-on-large-language-model-output/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preprint</a>]. Large language models can produce creative and diverse responses. However, to integrate them into current developer workflows, it is essential to constrain their outputs to follow specific formats or standards. This work surveyed 51 experienced industry professionals to understand the range of scenarios and motivations driving the need for output constraints from a user-centered perspective. The authors identified 134 concrete use cases for constraints at two levels: low-level, which ensures the output adhere to a structured format and an appropriate length, and high-level, which requires the output to follow semantic and stylistic guidelines without hallucination. Critically, applying output constraints could not only streamline the currently repetitive process of developing, testing, and integrating LLM prompts for developers, but also enhance the user experience of LLM-powered features and applications. The authors conclude with a discussion on user preferences and needs towards articulating intended constraints for LLMs, alongside an initial design for a constraint prototyping tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39396-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artificial intelligence driven design of catalysts and materials for ring opening polymerization using a domain-specific language</a> - <em><strong>Nature Communications</strong></em>, 2023.

[<a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/ibm-materials-notebook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project (⭐14)</a>]. Advances in machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation are poised to vastly accelerate research in polymer science. Data representation is a critical aspect for enabling ML integration in research workflows, yet many data models impose significant rigidity making it difficult to accommodate a broad array of experiment and data types found in polymer science. This inflexibility presents a significant barrier for researchers to leverage their historical data in ML development. This work shows that a domain specific language, termed Chemical Markdown Language (CMDL), provides flexible, extensible, and consistent representation of disparate experiment types and polymer structures. CMDL enables seamless use of historical experimental data to fine-tune regression transformer (RT) models for generative molecular design tasks. The authors demonstrate the utility of this approach through the generation and the experimental validation of catalysts and polymers in the context of ring-opening polymerization---although the authors provide examples of how CMDL can be more broadly applied to other polymer classes. Critically, this work shows how the CMDL tuned model preserves key functional groups within the polymer structure, allowing for experimental validation. These results reveal the versatility of CMDL and how it facilitates translation of historical data into meaningful predictive and generative models to produce experimentally actionable output.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Problem Solving / Planning</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-control-091420-084139\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Integrated Task and Motion Planning</a> - <em><strong>Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</strong></em>, 2021. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=478421650694199529\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. The problem of planning for a robot that operates in environments containing a large number of objects, taking actions to move itself through the world as well as to change the state of the objects, is known as task and motion planning (TAMP). TAMP problems contain elements of discrete task planning, discrete–continuous mathematical programming, and continuous motion planning and thus cannot be effectively addressed by any of these fields directly. In this article, the authors define a class of TAMP problems and survey algorithms for solving them, characterizing the solution methods in terms of their strategies for solving the continuous-space subproblems and their techniques for integrating the discrete and continuous components of the search.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><p>Science Logology / AI Assisted Research</p>\n</h5><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aay4275\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Machine learning-assisted molecular design and efficiency prediction for high-performance organic photovoltaic materials</a> - <em><strong>Science Advances</strong></em>, 2019. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12392230644945701722\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. In the process of finding high-performance materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is meaningful if one can establish the relationship between chemical structures and photovoltaic properties even before synthesizing them. This work first establishes a database containing over 1700 donor materials reported in the literature. Through supervised learning, our machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure-property relationship and, thus, implement fast screening of OPV materials. The authors explore several expressions for molecule structures, i.e., images, ASCII strings, descriptors, and fingerprints, as inputs for various ML algorithms. It is found that fingerprints with length over 1000 bits can obtain high prediction accuracy. The reliability of the approach is further verified by screening 10 newly designed donor materials. Good consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that ML is a powerful tool to prescreen new OPV materials, thus accelerating the development of the OPV field.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.162/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BioPlanner: Automatic Evaluation of LLMs on Protocol Planning in Biology</a> - <em><strong>EMNLP'23</strong></em>, 2023.
