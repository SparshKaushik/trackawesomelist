Sushi Draft includes a deck of 32 sushi cards (8 ikura, 7 ebi, 6 maguro, 5 tamago, 4 kappa and 2 \"wild\" triples) and 18 point tokens (three each for the five types of sushi and three for dessert); the point tokens range in value from 1-5, with the more plentiful sushi dishes being worth more points. Over three rounds, players draft plates of sushi and collect sushi points, which are drawn randomly. The player with the most diverse menu gets dessert. Players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins. Sushi Draft is quick to learn and fun for the whole family, and is the perfect introduction to the classic genre of pick-and-pass/card-drafting games!\n\n![Sushi Draft image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VBF3tF7GdSMA0j1E6HPlvQ__itemrep/img/wAInfSxdweuNqVxnL5Qsq5P_wtk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2062272.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

In PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers who will trek trails to see sites, observe wildlife, take photos, and visit national parks over the course of the game. They will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike. Each trail, represented by tiles, represents a different season, and as each season passes, the trails change and grow steadily longer. Each turn, players send one of their hikers down the trail. While on the trail, hikers will see beautiful sites and perform an action when they arrive. When a hiker reaches the end of the trail, they can spend tokens they have received to visit Parks and earn points. Your goal is to have the most points from your Parks, photos, and personal bonus at the end of the year.\n\n![PARKS image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mF2cSNRk2O6HtE45Sl9TcA__itemrep/img/aO688RtGLH5MV7LUHkmghPUjSJQ=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4852372.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The Estates is a new urban development featuring high-end infrastructure and a modern atmosphere for its citizens. The City Council recently approved the zoning map for The Estates. It calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street. The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City. Players will bid for the various building pieces and place them in The Estates to their benefit. All buildings in completed rows score positive points, while all buildings in incomplete rows score negative points. It is possible to have zero completed rows of buildings. At the end, the player with the highest score wins The Estates!\n\n![The Estates image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AvC3AzHo8JlcvgKtQ3PDWA__itemrep/img/fKXzvy-mkwqrTORbPC-aNLB_ei8=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4071903.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Every action turn brings you closer to finding the hidden, ancient symbol. But watch out; your opponent may be closer to solving your secret square than you think! The Telepathy board game is an outstanding logic building tool, ideal for educators and puzzle solvers alike. If you like Sudoku, Mastermind, or Battleship, this game is for you.\n\n![Telepathy Image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HUrpAkrqZVwcjN8HXzaZaQ__itemrep/img/glE42FIgi4qCUEiDZxT_qJ1Vckk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5283740.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The game is a modern and simplified variation of the game Halma.\n\n![Chinese Checkers game image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/ChineseCheckersboard.jpeg/300px-ChineseCheckersboard.jpeg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.\n\n![Abalone image](http://cdn.aktivcommunication.cz/images/products/box/4426.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.\n\n![Nine Men's Morris image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Nine_Men%27s_Morris_board_with_coordinates.svg/300px-Nine_Men%27s_Morris_board_with_coordinates.svg.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

The goal is to conquer and control as much of the player board as possible and halting your opponents' expansion. When your race can't expand any further you let it fall into decline and pick a new race to continue the quest for dominance.\n\n![Small World game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__itemrep/img/vxZGxHhrtnOMxPM38WNIu-tfYmI=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic428828.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.
