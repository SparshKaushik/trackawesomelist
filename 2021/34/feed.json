The output also consists of a graph and a section with packet level details. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bmon-640x480.png)\n*   **Bwm-ng**: (Bandwidth Monitor Next Generation) is another very simple real time network load monitor that reports a summary of the speed at which data is being transferred in and out of all available network interfaces on the system. [Screenshot](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/bwmng/screenshots/10965.jpg/245/183/1)\n*   **CBM**: (Color Bandwidth Meter) A tiny little simple bandwidth monitor that displays the traffic volume through network interfaces. No further options, just the traffic stats are display and updated in realtime. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cbm.png)\n*   **Collectl**: reports system statistics in a style that is similar to dstat, and like dstat it gathers statistics about various different system resources like cpu, memory, network etc. Over here is a simple example of how to use it to report network usage/bandwidth. [Screenshot](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-08/ftp/hw/collectl.png)\n*   **Dstat**: is a versatile tool (written in python) that can monitor different system statistics and report them in a batch style mode or log the data to a csv or similar file. This example shows how to use dstat to report network bandwidth [Screenshot](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dstat-Linux-Monitoring.png)\n*   **Ifstat**: reports the network bandwidth in a batch style mode. The output is in a format that is easy to log and parse using other programs or utilities. [Screenshot](https://community.linuxmint.com/img/screenshots/ifstat.png)\n*   **Iftop**: measures the data flowing through individual socket connections, and it works in a manner that is different from Nload. Iftop uses the pcap library to capture the packets moving in and out of the network adapter, and then sums up the size and count to find the total bandwidth under use. Although iftop reports the bandwidth used by individual connections, it cannot report the process name/id involved in the particular socket connection. But being based on the pcap library, iftop is able to filter the traffic and report bandwidth usage over selected host connections as specified by the filter. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iftop.png)\n*   **Jnettop**: [Jnettop](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jnettop/) is a traffic visualiser, which captures traffic going through the host it is running from and displays streams sorted by bandwidth they use. [Screenshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509072433if_/http://jnettop.kubs.info/wiki/?binary=internal%3A%2F%2F76195466cc3bca92f8de7b404e240844.gif)\n*   **Nethogs**: is a small 'net top' tool that shows the bandwidth used by individual processes and sorts the list putting the most intensive processes on top. In the event of a sudden bandwidth spike, quickly open nethogs and find the process responsible. Nethogs reports the PID, user and the path of the program. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nethogs.png)\n*   **Netload**: displays a small report on the current traffic load, and the total number of bytes transferred since the program start. No more features are there. Its part of the netdiag. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/netload.png)\n*   **Netwatch**: is part of the netdiag collection of tools, and it too displays the connections between local host and other remote hosts, and the speed at which data is transferring on each connection. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/netwatch.png)\n*   **Nload**: is a commandline tool that allows users to monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic separately. It also draws outa graph to indicate the same, the scale of which can be adjusted. Easy and simple to use, and does not support many options. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nload.png)\n*   **Pktstat**: displays all the active connections in real time, and the speed at which data is being transferred through them. It also displays the type of the connection, i.e. tcp or udp and also details about http requests if involved. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pktstat.png)\n*   **Slurm**: is 'yet' another network load monitor that shows device statistics along with an ascii graph. It supports 3 different styles of graphs each of which can be activated using the c, s and l keys. Simple in features, slurm does not display any further details about the network load. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/slurm.png)\n*   **Speedometer**: Another small and simple tool that just draws out good looking graphs of incoming and outgoing traffic through a given interface. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/speedometer.png)\n*   **Tcptrack**: is similar to iftop, and uses the pcap library to capture packets and calculate various statistics like the bandwidth used in each connection. It also supports the standard pcap filters that can be used to monitor specific connections. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tcptrack.png)\n*   **Trafshow**: reports the current active connections, their protocol and the data transfer speed on each connection. It can filter out connections using pcap type filters. [Screenshot](https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/trafshow.png)\n*   **Vnstat**: is bit different from most of the other tools. It actually runs a background service/daemon and keeps recording the size of data transfer all the time. Next it can be used to generate a report of the history of network usage. [Screenshot](https://www.howtoforge.com/images/vnstat/big/vnstat9.png)\n\n### Traffic Capture\n\n*   [Libpcap/Tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/): The official site of tcpdump, a powerful command-line packet analyzer; and libpcap, a portable C/C++ library for network traffic capture.\n*   [Ngrep (‚≠ê954)](https://github.com/jpr5/ngrep/): strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop. [Screenshot](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/cms/2012/12/ngrep.png)\n*   [n2disk](https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-recording-replay/n2disk/) (Commercial): A multi-Gigabit network traffic recorder with indexing capabilities. n2disk is a network traffic recorder application. With n2disk you can capture full- sized network packets at multi-Gigabit rate (above 10 Gigabit/s on adequate hardware) from a live network interface, and write them into files without any packet loss.\n*   [OpenFPC (‚≠ê72)](https://github.com/leonward/OpenFPC): OpenFPC is a set of scripts that combine to provide a lightweight full-packet network traffic recorder & buffering tool. Its design goal is to allow non-expert users to deploy a distributed network traffic recorder on COTS hardware while integrating into existing alert and log tools.\n*   [PF\\_RING](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/): PF\\_RING is a new type of network socket that dramatically improves the packet capture speed. Available for Linux kernels 2.6.32 and newer. No need to patch the kernel. PF\\_RING-aware drivers for increased packet capture acceleration.\n*   [TTT](https://www2.sonycsl.co.jp/person/kjc/kjc/software.html#ttt): (Tele Traffic Tapper) is yet another descendant of tcpdump but it is capable of real-time, graphical, and remote traffic-monitoring. ttt won't replace tcpdump, rather, it helps you find out what to look into with tcpdump. ttt monitors the network and automatically picks up the main contributors of the traffic within the time window. The graphs are updated every second by default.\n\n### Traffic Analysis/Inspection\n\n*   [CoralReef](https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/coralreef/): is a software suite developed by CAIDA to analyze data collected by passive Internet traffic monitors. It provides a programming library libcoral, similar to libpcap with extensions for ATM and other network types, which is available from both C and Perl.\n*   [DPDK](https://www.dpdk.org/): is a set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing. It was designed to run on any processors. The first supported CPU was Intel x86 and it is now extended to IBM Power 8, EZchip TILE-Gx and ARM. It runs mostly in Linux userland. A FreeBSD port is available for a subset of DPDK features.\n*   [ECap](https://web.archive.org/web/20170715080351/https://bitbucket.org/nathanj/ecap/wiki/Home): (External Capture) is a distributed network sniffer with a web front- end. Ecap was written many years ago in 2005, but a post on the tcpdump-workers mailing list requested a similar application... so here it is. It would be fun to update it and work on it again if there's any interest.\n*   [EtherApe](https://etherape.sourceforge.io/): is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after etherman. Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays network activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic. Color coded protocols display. It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well as live from the network.\n*   [Ipsumdump (‚≠ê38)](https://github.com/kohler/ipsumdump): summarizes TCP/IP dump files into a self-describing ASCII format easily readable by humans and programs. Ipsumdump can read packets from network interfaces, from tcpdump files, and from existing ipsumdump files. It will transparently uncompress tcpdump or ipsumdump files when necessary. It can randomly sample traffic, filter traffic based on its contents, anonymize IP addresses, and sort packets from multiple dumps by timestamp. Also, it can optionally create a tcpdump file containing actual packet data. It's also convenient to work with CLICK as a inserted module.\n*   [ITA](https://web.archive.org/web/20181016104652/http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/traces.html): The Internet Traffic Archive is a moderated repository to support widespread access to traces of Internet network traffic, sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. The traces can be used to study network dynamics, usage characteristics, and growth patterns, as well as providing the grist for trace- driven simulations. The archive is also open to programs for reducing raw trace data to more manageable forms, for generating synthetic traces, and for analyzing traces.\n*   [Libcrafter (‚≠ê304)](https://github.com/pellegre/libcrafter): is a high level library for C++ designed to make easier the creation and decoding of network packets. It is able to craft or decode packets of most common network protocols, send them on the wire, capture them and match requests and replies.\n*   [Libnet (‚≠ê935)](https://github.com/libnet/libnet): is a collection of routines to help with the construction and handling of network packets. It provides a portable framework for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with little effort.\n*   [Multitail](https://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/): now has a colorscheme included for monitoring the tcpdump output. It can also filter, convert timestamps to timestrings and much more.\n*   [Netsniff-ng](https://www.github.com/borkmann/netsniff-ng): Netsniff-ng is a toolkit of free Linux networking utilities, a Swiss army knife for your daily Linux network plumbing if you will.\n*   [Network Expect](https://www.netexpect.org/): is a framework that allows to easily build tools that can interact with network traffic. Following a script, traffic can be injected into the network, and decisions can be taken, and acted upon, based on received network traffic. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control structures to direct the interaction with the network. Network Expect uses libpcap for packet capture and libwireshark (from the Wireshark project) for packet dissection tasks. (GPL, BSD/Linux/OSX).\n*   [Ntopng](https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/): Ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does. ntop is based on libpcap and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform, MacOSX and on Win32 as well.\n*   [pyshark](https://kiminewt.github.io/pyshark/): A Python wrapper for tshark, allowing python packet parsing using wireshark dissectors. There are quite a few python packet parsing modules, this one is different because it doesn't actually parse any packets, it simply uses tshark's (wireshark command-line utility) ability to export XMLs to use its parsing.\n*   [Sanitize](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210101529/http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/sanitize.html): Sanitize is a collection of five Bourne shell scripts for reducing tcpdump traces in order to address security and privacy concerns, by renumbering hosts and stripping out packet contents. Each script takes as input a tcpdump trace file and generates to stdout a reduced, ASCII file in fixed-column format.\n*   [Socket Sentry (‚≠ê4)](https://github.com/rhasselbaum/socket-sentry): Socket Sentry is a real-time network traffic monitor for KDE Plasma in the same spirit as tools like iftop and netstat.\n*   [Tcpreplay (‚≠ê1.3k)](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay): Replays a pcap file on an interface using libnet.\n*   [Tcpslice (‚≠ê8)](https://github.com/pyke369/tcpsplice): Tcpslice is a tool for extracting portions of packet trace files generated using tcpdump's -w flag. It can combine multiple trace files, and/or extract portions of one or more traces based on time.\n*   [Tcpsplit (‚≠ê7)](https://github.com/pmcgleenon/tcpsplit): A tool to break a single libpcap packet trace into some number of sub- traces, breaking the trace along TCP connection boundaries so that a TCP connection doesn't end up split across two sub-traces. This is useful for making large trace files tractable for in- depth analysis and for subsetting a trace for developing analysis on only part of a trace.\n*   [Tcpstat](https://frenchfries.net/paul/tcpstat/): Tcpstat reports certain network interface statistics much like vmstat does for system statistics. tcpstat gets its information by either monitoring a specific interface, or by reading previously saved tcpdump data from a file.\n*   [WAND](https://research.wand.net.nz/): A wonderful collection of tools built on libtrace to process network traffic, which is from The University of Waikato. I love this project!\n*   [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/): An extract of a message from Guy Harris on state of WinPcap and WinDump.\n*   [Wireshark suit](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Tools): The well-known tool suit to support packet analyzer and protocol decoder. It also includes a few practical tools and scripts to support most of the common usage.\n\n### File Extraction\n\n*   [Snort](https://www.snort.org/): is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) developed by Sourcefire, now owned by Cisco. Combining the benefits of signature, protocol and anomaly- based inspection, Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide.\n*   [Dsniff](https://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/): Dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.\n*   [Foremost (‚≠ê54)](https://github.com/jonstewart/foremost): is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.\n*   [Justniffer](https://onotelli.github.io/justniffer/): Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all \"intercepted\" files from the HTTP traffic.\n*   [NetworkMiner](https://www.netresec.com/index.ashx?page=NetworkMiner): NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows (but also works in Linux / Mac OS X / FreeBSD). NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/ reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files.\n\n### DNS Utilities\n\n*   [dnsgram](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/manpages/dnsgram.1.html): dnsgram is a debugging tool for intermittent resolver failures. it takes one or more input PCAP files and generates statistics on 5 second segments allowing the study of intermittent resolver issues.\n*   [dnsreplay](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/manpages/dnsreplay.1.html): Dnsreplay takes recorded questions and answers and replays them to the specified nameserver and reporting afterwards which percentage of answers matched, were worse or better. Then compares the answers and some other metrics with the actual ones with those found in the dumpfile.\n*   [dnsscan](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/manpages/dnsscan.1.html): dnsscan takes one or more INFILEs in PCAP format and generates a list of the number of queries per query type.\n*   [dnsscope](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/manpages/dnsscope.1.html): dnsscope takes an input PCAP and generates some simple statistics outputs these to console.\n*   [dnswasher](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/manpages/dnswasher.1.html): dnswasher takes an input file in PCAP format and writes out a PCAP file, while obfuscating end-user IP addresses. This is useful to share data with third parties while attempting to protect the privacy of your users.\n\n### Related Projects / Analysis\n\n*   [BPF for Ultrix](https://www.tcpdump.org/other/bpfext42.tar.Z): A distribution of BPF for Ultrix 4.2, with both source code and binary modules.\n*   [BPF+](https://andrewbegel.com/papers/bpf.pdf): Exploiting Global Data-flow Optimization in a Generalized Packet Filter Architecture By Andrew Begel, Steven McCanne, and Susan Graham.\n*   [FFT-FGN-C](ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/fft_fgn_c.html): is a program for synthesizing a type of self-similar process known as fractional Gaussian noise. The program is fast but approximate. Fractional Gaussian noise is only one type of self-similar process. When using this program for synthesizing network traffic, you must keep in mind that it may be that the traffic you seek is better modeled using one of the other processes.\n*   [Traffic Data Repository at the WIDE Project](https://www2.sonycsl.co.jp/person/kjc/papers/freenix2000/): It becomes increasingly important for both network researchers and operators to know the trend of network traffic and to find anomaly in their network traffic. This paper describes an on-going effort within the WIDE project to collect a set of free tools to build a traffic data repository containing detailed information of our backbone traffic. Traffic traces are collected by tcpdump and, after removing privacy information, the traces are made open to the public. We review the issues on user privacy, and then, the tools used to build the WIDE traffic repository. We will report the current status and findings in the early stage of our IPv6 deployment.",
