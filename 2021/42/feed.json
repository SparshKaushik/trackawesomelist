The \"denouement mechanic\" is a special type of storytelling game, where the key elements of the stories events are determined by the game, then the players must weave them together in the most inventive of ways.\nNoir is packed with a grim cast of Femme Fatales, gum shoe P.I.s, mean Mobsters and hardened Hit Men. The play throws up stories which are by turns dark, hilarious, inventive and always, always memorable.\nAt the bitter end the best denouement of the game wins!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4gaw7uVUCijAZa5bnZP84Q__itemrep/img/iymr5JN2rzqoDvm7soJFk0IvquI=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic3941376.png\" alt=\"Noir game image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.
