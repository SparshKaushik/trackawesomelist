  <i>The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.</i><br />
  — Tom DeMarco<sup><a href="#intro-quote-def">[1]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>A curated <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg" alt="Awesome" /></a> list <strong>for software developers to transition to an engineering management role</strong>. Compiles advice, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions, industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last few years while <a href="https://devtomanager.com/interviews/kevin-deldycke/" rel="noopener noreferrer">transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager</a>. And later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right? ʘ‿ʘ).</p>
<ul>
<li>You're a developer and wonders what it feels like to be a manager?</li>
<li>You just started your first position as the leader of a team?</li>
<li>You're stuck into the day-to-day operations of the job?</li>
<li>How can I move up to the next level?</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll find answers in this guide! It stands out from generic leadership and management literature, by providing uncompromising insights and practical advice. It will bootstrap your journey into the management career track, from a technical background.</p>
<p>This list helps in the transition to management, with a progression from general to specifics. It starts with an overview of the role, then describes its requirements, and its position relative to others. Then we details the day-to-day tools of the trade, both organizational and behavioral. At last we discuss some of the dark sides of the job.</p>

Leave that to the engineers: your value lies elsewhere now. But does that means you must forget all things technical? The answer is an astounding <em>NO</em>. Here are some arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://increment.com/teams/do-engineering-managers-need-to-be-technical/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do engineering managers need to be technical?</a> - Yes. “Looking forward to the next 30 years of management trends, only a few things seem certain: Managers should be technical, and the definition of technical will continue to change.”</p>

<li><p><a href="https://archive.ph/J2vlo#selection-1025.8-1025.64" rel="noopener noreferrer">If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work</a> - “Although we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work – type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance – they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.”</p>
