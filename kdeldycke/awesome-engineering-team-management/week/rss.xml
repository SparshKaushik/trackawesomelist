<ul>
<li>Reflecting on the postulates above, <a href="https://x.com/bcantrill/status/1216491615264489473?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryan Cantrill defines that the role of management</a> ‚Äúis in constructing that environment, not micromanaging it. If engineering performance is suffering, it's (likely) a management problem: wrong problem, wrong mission, or wrong team -- or all three.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Motivation / Happiness</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúMy team tracks life impact as a metric (pages outside business hours) and works to drive that down to zero.‚Äù (<a href="https://x.com/dwc/status/962179099606200320" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>) - Maybe the best indicator of a happy team is how little it is disturbed outside office hours.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3><p>Cognitive Tools / Problem Solving</p>
</h3>
<ul>

<h3><p>Engineering / The Technical Engineering Manager</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/J2vlo#selection-1025.8-1025.64" rel="noopener noreferrer">If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work</a> - ‚ÄúAlthough we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work ‚Äì type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance ‚Äì they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Engineering / Technology</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúSoftware development is more akin to the product design and development phase of industrial production than to the manufacturing.‚Äù (<a href="https://accu.org/bookreviews/1998/kloss_1668/" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>) - This quote is from a review of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201502089?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=kevideld-20&amp;linkId=dc65849a678d52afa9f3685159673d6e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Superdistribution - Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier</em></a>, in which the creator of Objective-C was advocating in the 90's for a new economic framework that rewards creation of components in proportion to their use.

A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (‚Ä¶) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical debt as a lack of understanding</a> - ‚ÄúThe problem lies in "never reorganizing [the code] to reflect your understanding." (‚Ä¶) Organizationally, you pay in velocity and turnover; talented people are going to leave after a few rounds of bullshit.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Remote Work / Technical Debt</p>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250506052542/https://async.twist.com/asynchronous-communication/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asynchronous Communication: The Real Reason Remote Workers Are More Productive</a> - ‚ÄúRemote workers are more productive than their office-bound counterparts.‚Äù</li>

<li><a href="https://archive.ph/1P4FQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dear Manager, You're Holding Too Many Meetings</a> - ‚ÄúEmployee productivity was 71% higher when meetings were reduced by 40%. This is largely because employees felt more empowered and autonomous. Rather than a schedule being the boss, they owned their to-do lists and held themselves accountable.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

</h3>

<li><a href="https://archive.ph/vH4D1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Things Many People Find Too Obvious To Have Told You Already</a> - A set of heuristics on tech companies and the ecosystem they live in.</li>

</ul>
<h3><p>Product Management / Product Strategy</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mobile.x.com/trevmckendrick/status/1218748974321954816" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúWhy does the tire company rate restaurants‚Äù</a> - A great example on why you should investigate complementary businesses.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Windows Vista as a prime example of a <a href="https://x.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/851861076429991937" rel="noopener noreferrer">sacrificial lamb product</a>: a massive unpopular re-architecture required to pave the way for future innovative release. That's the cautionary tale of why you should be ready for intense criticism and adversity, if by chance or fate your wander down the path of monumental changes in a business software.</li>

Collect requirement lists from customers and prospective customers; 2. Make sure their product checks every damn box, no matter how stupid.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄúLinear roadmaps are misleading‚Äù (<a href="https://x.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1296818042928861184" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>).</li>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/LmRl0D-RkPU?t=3202" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin talk about professionalism in software development</a> - The only honest estimate is "I don't know". But you can come up with some kind of probability assessment, that will inform about the shape of the risk. This is not unlike PERT, where an activity is bounded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique#Time" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely time</a>. Now if managers don't take a range for an answer, don't fall in that trap. Tell them you're already trying as you possibly can. ‚ÄúAnd then the manager will have to do something very foreign: they'll have to manage. That's what management is: managing risk.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Agile / Delivery</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/pSUhM" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why do some developers at Google consider Agile development to be nonsense?</a> - Because the short-term focused Scrum processes ‚Äúseem suited to particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs the show because they are paying for development, and can change their mind at any time‚Äù. Still, google engineers already practice a culture close to what looks like the original 10-points Agile manifesto. But that's it.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><p>Roles / Engineers</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/papers/Li2015GreatEngineers.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Makes A Great Software Engineer?</a> - Doesn't conclude on a definitive answer to the question, but details a model based on 53 attributes (!). Still a good source referencing other papers on the topic.</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Motivation / Negotiation</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not</a> - ‚Äú1. Autonomy for software engineers; 2. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources; 3. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency; 4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics; 5. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangle-communication; 6. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience; 7. Higher leverage --&gt; higher {autonomy, pay}‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Engineering / Technical Debt</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodbye, Clean Code</a> - ‚ÄúMy boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was clean! (‚Ä¶) I see now that my 'refactoring' was a disaster in two ways: I didn't talk to the person who wrote it; My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Product Management / Product-Market Fit</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wasted $40k on a fantastic startup idea</a> - A tale of building a product no user want to pay for. ‚ÄúYou can't just create value for the user: that's a charity. You also can't just create value for your company: that's a scam. Your goal is to set up some kind of positive-sum exchange, where everyone benefits, including you. A business plan, according to this textbook, starts with this simple question: how will you create value for yourself and the company?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Product Management / Product Strategy</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talking about Vista, Microsoft found out following its unsuccessful launch that <a href="https://augustl.com/blog/2019/best_bug_predictor_is_organizational_complexity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the #1 bug predictor is not technical, it's organizational complexity</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Agile / Delivery</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Failed #SquadGoals - Spotify doesn't use "the Spotify model" and neither should you</a> - ‚ÄúWhy it didn't work? 1. Matrix management solved the wrong problem; 2. It fixated on team autonomy; 3. Collaboration was an assumed competency; 4. Mythology became difficult to change‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Career / Performance Reviews</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get your work recognized: write a brag document</a> - There's this idea that, if you do great work at your job, people will (or should!) automatically recognize that work and reward you for it with promotions / increased pay. In practice, it's often more complicated than that.</li>
</ul>
<h3><p>Compensation / Salary</p>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21823987" rel="noopener noreferrer">L8-L10 salaries at AWS</a> - A reference point to what $M+ compensation packages looks like.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/08/28/Optimize-Onboarding.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimize Onboarding</a> - ‚ÄúYour organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company.

<ul>
<li>‚ÄúLots of people make the mistake of thinking there's only two vectors you can go to improve performance, high or wide. High - throw hardware at the problem, on a single machine.

<h3><p>Politics / Equity</p>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThis is what I loved about working at Netflix. We didn't have performance reviews. It was assumed that your performance was good to excellent, otherwise you wouldn't be working there anymore.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄúIn a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn't react.

My cautionary tale: this might only work up to a point depending on the company's culture.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄúWhen everything is great success, people behind that success shadow the people who could make success in the future. (‚Ä¶) Netflix is great example of how to do big transition right.
