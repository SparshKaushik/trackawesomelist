No further options, just the traffic stats are display and updated in realtime. <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cbm.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Collectl</strong>: reports system statistics in a style that is similar to dstat, and like dstat it gathers statistics about various different system resources like cpu, memory, network etc. Over here is a simple example of how to use it to report network usage/bandwidth. <a href="https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-08/ftp/hw/collectl.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dstat</strong>: is a versatile tool (written in python) that can monitor different system statistics and report them in a batch style mode or log the data to a csv or similar file.

</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Iftop</strong>: measures the data flowing through individual socket connections, and it works in a manner that is different from Nload. Iftop uses the pcap library to capture the packets moving in and out of the network adapter, and then sums up the size and count to find the total bandwidth under use. Although iftop reports the bandwidth used by individual connections, it cannot report the process name/id involved in the particular socket connection. But being based on the pcap library, iftop is able to filter the traffic and report bandwidth usage over selected host connections as specified by the filter. <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iftop.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Slurm</strong>: is 'yet' another network load monitor that shows device statistics along with an ascii graph. It supports 3 different styles of graphs each of which can be activated using the c, s and l keys. Simple in features, slurm does not display any further details about the network load. <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/slurm.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speedometer</strong>: Another small and simple tool that just draws out good looking graphs of incoming and outgoing traffic through a given interface. <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/speedometer.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tcptrack</strong>: is similar to iftop, and uses the pcap library to capture packets and calculate various statistics like the bandwidth used in each connection. It also supports the standard pcap filters that can be used to monitor specific connections. <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tcptrack.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>
</ul>

It can filter out connections using pcap type filters. <a href="https://www.binarytides.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/trafshow.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vnstat</strong>: is bit different from most of the other tools. It actually runs a background service/daemon and keeps recording the size of data transfer all the time. Next it can be used to generate a report of the history of network usage. <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/images/vnstat/big/vnstat9.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenshot</a></li>

It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...), etc.</li>

The scripts look only at TCP SYN/FIN/RST packets. Connections without SYN packets in the trace (such as those on- going at the beginning of the trace) will not appear in the summary. Garbaged packets (those missing some of their contents) are reported to stderr as bogon's and are discarded. Occasionally the script gets fooled by retransmissions with altered sequence numbers, and reports erroneous huge connection sizes - always check large connections (say 100 MB or more) for plausibility.</li>
