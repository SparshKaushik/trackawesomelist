It ships a slightly customized Emacs with SLIME, SBCL (a popular Common Lisp implementation), Quicklisp and Git. No installation needed, so it's a very quick and easy way to get going.\n    *   [Lispbox](https://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/) - An IDE (Emacs + SLIME), Common Lisp implementation (Clozure Common Lisp) and library manager (Quicklisp), pre-packaged as archives for Windows, macOS and Linux. Descendant of \"Lisp in a Box\" [mentioned](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/lather-rinse-repeat-a-tour-of-the-repl.html) in Practical Common Lisp.\n    *   [Lispworks Personal Edition](http://www.lispworks.com/downloads/) - A non-Emacs based IDE for LispWorks Lisp, with some restrictions.\n    *   [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegrocl/) - Has a free [Express Edition](https://franz.com/downloads/clp/survey) IDE, and [training videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN36UrxtyNBJPaG0kmBJNRw).\n*   For advanced users\n    *   [Articulate Common Lisp](http://articulate-lisp.com) - A HOWTO for putting together a Lisp environment, and has information on [useful libraries](http://articulate-lisp.com/project/abcs.html) and how to [structure projects](http://articulate-lisp.com/project/new-project.html).\n    *   If you're an experienced [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user, you can just install [SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) and a [supported Common Lisp implementation](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Platforms.html#Platforms). See the [SLIME manual](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/) for more details.\n    *   The Common Lisp Cookbook has more information about [installing an implementation](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html) using an implementation manager like [Roswell (⭐1.8k)](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki), or on Docker.\n\n### Online References\n\n*   [The Common Lisp Hyperspec (CLHS)](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html) - *The* language reference document for Common Lisp. Bookmark it now.\n    *   [Chapter 7](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/07_.htm) - Covers the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).\n*   [The ANSI Common Lisp Standard Draft](http://cberr.us/tech_writings/notes/common_lisp_standard_draft.html) - The last draft version of the ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (previously ANSI X3.226-1994) standard.\n    *   The draft is free, the standard isn't.\n    *   It's pretty much the same as the official standard, and some people prefer it to the CLHS.\n*   [The Common Lisp Cookbook](http://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/) - A list of useful Lisp recipes. Also contains a list of other online sources of CL information.\n*   [Common Lisp the Language (2nd Edition) by Guy L. Steele](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html) - A description of the Common Lisp language from just before it was standardized by ANSI. Don't use it as a reference.\n    *   [Cliki on CLtL2](https://cliki.net/Getting+Started) - Claims it has more useful descriptions of [LOOP](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node235.html#SECTION003000000000000000000) and [FORMAT](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node200.html) than the CLHS does.\n    *   [Stack Overflow on CLtL2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/108537/what-are-the-main-differences-between-cltl2-and-ansi-cl) - Some recommend using CLtL2 for insight and inspiration, but to use the CLHS when programming.\n    *   [A list of differences between CLtL2 and the ANSI Common Lisp specification.](http://linuxfinances.info/info/commonlisp.html#AEN9679)\n    *   [Chapter 28](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node260.html#SECTION003200000000000000000) - Covers the Common Lisp Object System.\n\n### Online Books\n\n*   [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/) - a good introduction for people new to programming. Contains code for really useful utilities like [DTRACE](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Lisp/dtrace/) and [SDRAW](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Lisp/sdraw/).\n*   [Common Lisp: An interactive approach by Stuart C. Shapiro](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Commonlisp/) - A textbook that teaches mainly through the use of exercises.\n*   [Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) - A great introduction for experienced programmers, and tries to highlight from the very beginning what makes CL different to other languages.\n*   [Common Lisp Koans (⭐3.2k)](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans) - Not exactly a book, but a set of koans to help you learn the language.\n*   [On Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) - A great book for intermediately experienced Lispers.\n*   [Let Over Lambda by Doug Hoyte](https://letoverlambda.com) - An advanced book on Lisp Macros.\n    *   The first six chapters are available online.\n    *   [Comments on Let Over Lambda](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/3actsc/let_over_lambda/) - Several people recommend that you be comfortable with On Lisp before reading this book, and that the start is slow.\n    *   [The chapter on closures](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html) - Has several non-trivial examples, and demonstrates the power of this feature.\n*   [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming by Peter Norvig (⭐7.3k)](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp) - Has many interesting applications of Lisp, but is no longer a good reference for AI.\n\n### Offline Books\n\n*   [Land of Lisp by Conrad Barski, MD](http://landoflisp.com) - A fun introduction to Lisp that uses comics and has you writing games.\n    *   Available as an [ebook](https://www.nostarch.com/lisp.htm).\n    *   A couple of the LOOP macros are written `for x for y...` which you can change to `for x from 0 for y...` to make them work in SBCL.\n    *   Has an [errata page](http://landoflisp.com/errata.html).\n    *   Most of the book is entertaining and fairly easy, but gets hairy from about Chapter 18. It doesn't feel like later chapters introduce much, so I recommend switching to a different book at that point.\n    *   The Web server example in Ch 13, 19 and 20 will only work on CLISP, and needs the addition of HTTP response headers to render the HTML properly.\n*   [ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html) - Good as a reference, covers CLOS, and has several example program implementations.\n    *   Plaintext versions of [Chapter 1](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl1.txt) and [Chapter 2](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl2.txt) are available online.\n*   [Common Lisp Recipes by Edmund Weitz](http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/) - A great set of Common Lisp patterns.\n*   [Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp by Sonya E. Keene](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-COMMON-LISP-Programmers/dp/0201175894) - An in-depth description of the CLOS, and shows how to use it with example applications.\n*   [The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres, and Daniel G. Bobrow](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/) - Describes the CLOS Metaobject Protocol (MOP).\n    *   [Chapters 5 and 6 (available online)](http://metamodular.com/CLOS-MOP/) - The specification of a metaobject protocol extension to CLOS, by Robert Strandh.\n        *   Superseded by the [modern public domain CLOS MOP specification](https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/) by Jean-Philippe Paradis ([Hexstream](https://github.com/Hexstream)).\n    *   [Adam Tornhill on AMOP](http://www.adamtornhill.com/reviews/amop.htm) - Recommends reading Practical Common Lisp, then  Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp, and then AMOP.\n\n### Online Community\n\n*   The [Cliki](http://cliki.net) - The Common Lisp Wiki. A great resource for all things CL.
