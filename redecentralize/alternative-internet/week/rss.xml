<ul>
<li><a href="https://remotestorage.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">remoteStorage</a> is an open protocol for per-user storage on the Web. Users can: own their data, have everything stored in one place, syncronise across multiple devices, use the same data across different apps, and work offline. Developers can: avoid creating backends, scale without cost, and start quickly with a JavaScript library handling all aspects of the protocol.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://solidproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solidproject.org</a> Solid is a project lead by Tim Berners Lee that aims to re-decentralize the web. Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized Web applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible. It relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols. You can find more information also at <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inrupt</a> and <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solid MIT</a> webpages</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arkos.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">arkOS</a> is an operating system and software stack to easily host your own websites, email addresses, cloud services and more. It uses a graphical interface (called Genesis) to do all of this, with a focus on end-user experience and simple design.
