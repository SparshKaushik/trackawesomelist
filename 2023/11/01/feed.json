This can be in various forms such as text, images, sounds, or other datasets. This data serves as the foundational material that the AI uses to recognize and understand patterns.\n*   **Training the AI**: With the data in hand, the next step is 'training'. During this phase, the AI processes the data multiple times to learn and internalize the patterns present. The outcome of this stage is a 'model', which acts like a digital representation of the knowledge derived from the data.\n*   **Fine-Tuning**: At times, there's a need for the AI to focus on specific nuances or characteristics. In such cases, an additional set of data is used to 'fine-tune' the already trained model, enhancing its capabilities in the desired direction.\n*   **Using the Model**: After training, the model is prepared to make inferences, which means using its acquired knowledge to process new data and come up with relevant outputs. This inference process can be executed locally on a machine or can be accessed remotely through an 'API'. The choice between local execution and API access often depends on factors like computational resources, application needs, and user preferences. Whether locally or via an API, the goal is to leverage the model's capabilities to derive meaningful results from new data inputs.\n*   **Generating New Data**: With the model set up, the AI can now produce or 'generate' new data. By giving the AI certain 'input parameters' or guidelines, it returns with 'generated output', which is the newly created content.\n*   **Applications**: The output generated by the AI can be incorporated into a range of applications, be it websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms. The 'interface' refers to the user-facing portion of these applications, enabling users to interact with and benefit from the AI's capabilities.\n\n### Generative AI Tools Directories\n\n*   [The Generative AI Landscape](https://ai-collection.org/): \"a collection of awesome generative AI applications\"\n*   [The ultimate list of AI tools for creators | Descript](https://www.descript.com/blog/article/the-ultimate-list-of-ai-tools-for-creators): collection organized by Descript\n\n### LangChain / Multi-agents\n\n*   [Langchain for paper summarization](https://lancemartin.notion.site/lancemartin/Langchain-for-paper-summarization-d4ad122ea9a64c0eb1f981e743d6c419)\n*   [Embedchain (⭐37k)](https://github.com/embedchain/embedchain): Framework to create ChatGPT like bots over your dataset\n*   [FlowiseAI](https://flowiseai.com/): \"Open source UI visual tool to build your customized LLM flow using LangchainJS, written in Node Typescript/Javascript\"\n*   [LangChain Docs](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#): Python library that helps building applications with LLMs through composability\n*   [Getting started with LangChain | by Avra | Feb, 2023 | Medium](https://medium.com/@avra42/getting-started-with-langchain-a-powerful-tool-for-working-with-large-language-models-286419ba0842): A powerful tool for working with Large Language Models\n\n### AI Tools for Searching / Multi-agents\n\n*   [whitead/paper-qa](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa): \"LLM Chain for answering questions from documents with citations\"\n*   [Metaphor](https://metaphor.systems/): search engine that \"understands language — in the form of prompts — so you can say what you're looking for in all the expressive and creative ways\"\n\n### AI Tools for Research / Multi-agents\n\n*   [\\[2310.17143\\] Supercharging academic writing with generative AI: framework, techniques, and caveats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17143)\n*   [Elicit](https://elicit.org/): automate research workflow for literature review\n*   [Paper Brain](https://www.paperbrain.study/): summarizer for paper parts.

This can be in various forms such as text, images, sounds, or other datasets. This data serves as the foundational material that the AI uses to recognize and understand patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Training the AI</strong>: With the data in hand, the next step is 'training'. During this phase, the AI processes the data multiple times to learn and internalize the patterns present. The outcome of this stage is a 'model', which acts like a digital representation of the knowledge derived from the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong>: At times, there's a need for the AI to focus on specific nuances or characteristics. In such cases, an additional set of data is used to 'fine-tune' the already trained model, enhancing its capabilities in the desired direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using the Model</strong>: After training, the model is prepared to make inferences, which means using its acquired knowledge to process new data and come up with relevant outputs. This inference process can be executed locally on a machine or can be accessed remotely through an 'API'. The choice between local execution and API access often depends on factors like computational resources, application needs, and user preferences. Whether locally or via an API, the goal is to leverage the model's capabilities to derive meaningful results from new data inputs.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generating New Data</strong>: With the model set up, the AI can now produce or 'generate' new data. By giving the AI certain 'input parameters' or guidelines, it returns with 'generated output', which is the newly created content.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applications</strong>: The output generated by the AI can be incorporated into a range of applications, be it websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms. The 'interface' refers to the user-facing portion of these applications, enabling users to interact with and benefit from the AI's capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Generative AI Tools Directories</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ai-collection.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Generative AI Landscape</a>: \"a collection of awesome generative AI applications\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.descript.com/blog/article/the-ultimate-list-of-ai-tools-for-creators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The ultimate list of AI tools for creators | Descript</a>: collection organized by Descript</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>LangChain / Multi-agents</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lancemartin.notion.site/lancemartin/Langchain-for-paper-summarization-d4ad122ea9a64c0eb1f981e743d6c419\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Langchain for paper summarization</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/embedchain/embedchain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Embedchain (⭐37k)</a>: Framework to create ChatGPT like bots over your dataset</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://flowiseai.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FlowiseAI</a>: \"Open source UI visual tool to build your customized LLM flow using LangchainJS, written in Node Typescript/Javascript\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangChain Docs</a>: Python library that helps building applications with LLMs through composability</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@avra42/getting-started-with-langchain-a-powerful-tool-for-working-with-large-language-models-286419ba0842\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting started with LangChain | by Avra | Feb, 2023 | Medium</a>: A powerful tool for working with Large Language Models</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>AI Tools for Searching / Multi-agents</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whitead/paper-qa</a>: \"LLM Chain for answering questions from documents with citations\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://metaphor.systems/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metaphor</a>: search engine that \"understands language — in the form of prompts — so you can say what you're looking for in all the expressive and creative ways\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>AI Tools for Research / Multi-agents</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17143\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[2310.17143] Supercharging academic writing with generative AI: framework, techniques, and caveats</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://elicit.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elicit</a>: automate research workflow for literature review</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.paperbrain.study/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paper Brain</a>: summarizer for paper parts.
