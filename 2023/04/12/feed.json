It supports rich data types and is widely used in NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB.\n*   [CSV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) - A simple and widely used data format that stores tabular data in plain text. It is easy to read and write, and can be processed by most programming languages.\n*   [JSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) - A lightweight and easy-to-read data format that is widely used for data exchange. It supports a wide range of data types and is compatible with many programming languages.\n\n### Resources / Protocols\n\n*   [AMQP 0-9-1](https://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf) - A message queuing protocol that enables the exchange of messages between applications or systems. AMQP 0-9-1 provides reliability, security, and flexibility to handle complex messaging scenarios.\n*   [AMQP 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-overview-v1.0-os.html) - A widely accepted message queuing protocol that provides reliable, interoperable, and efficient messaging between systems. AMQP 1.0 supports a broad range of messaging scenarios and is ideal for complex enterprise-level applications.\n*   [CoAP](http://coap.technology/) - A specialized application protocol designed for constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. CoAP offers a lightweight, low-overhead communication mechanism to support resource-constrained devices.\n*   [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) - A simple and lightweight remote procedure call protocol that enables communication between systems using JSON data. JSON-RPC offers stateless communication and is suitable for resource-constrained devices.\n*   [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/mqtt-specification/) - A lightweight and efficient publish-subscribe protocol that supports messaging between devices. MQTT enables low-overhead communication and is ideal for IoT and mobile applications.\n*   [SOAP](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap/) - A messaging protocol that uses XML to enable communication between systems. SOAP supports a wide range of messaging scenarios, including distributed computing and enterprise applications.\n*   [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/) - A messaging protocol that offers simple, text-oriented communication between systems. STOMP is ideal for low-latency, high-performance messaging scenarios.\n\n### Resources / Standard APIs\n\n*   [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) - A Java-based API that provides universal data access to relational databases. JDBC offers a consistent and efficient way to access and manipulate data, making it a popular choice among developers.\n*   [JMS](https://javaee.github.io/jms-spec/) - A messaging API that enables Java applications to send and receive messages. JMS supports reliable messaging and is widely used in enterprise-level applications.\n*   [ODBC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/odbc-overview) - A widely accepted API that provides a standardized way to access data from various database management systems. ODBC offers a consistent interface to access data, making it easy to develop database applications.\n*   [OData](https://www.odata.org/) - An open protocol that enables the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable REST APIs. OData simplifies the development of REST APIs and offers a standardized way to access data.\n\n### Resources / Structure and Validation\n\n*   [Schematron](https://www.schematron.com) - A rule-based validation language that enables developers to define and validate business rules, data reporting, quality control, and other validation scenarios. Schematron offers a flexible way to validate XML documents.\n*   [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/) - A schema language that offers facilities for describing the structure and constraining the contents of XML documents. XML Schema enables developers to ensure that XML data conforms to a specific structure, making it easier to process and manipulate.",
