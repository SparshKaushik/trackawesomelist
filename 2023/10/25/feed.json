Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.\n\n![Checkers image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/CheckersStandard.jpg/250px-CheckersStandard.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. \"there are ten sixes\". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.\n\n![Perudo](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__itemrep/img/4LfYxtsu5ylAYZNK7_Qbefe7kqk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3949242.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players begin with a home tile and eight workers, each in red, yellow, or blue, which are used for bidding on tiles and for resource generation and skill acquisition. During spring, summer, and autumn, additional workers with skills related to key resources like iron, stone, and wood arrive, and random village tiles are auctioned. In the winter, no new workers arrive, and players select village tiles for auction, which offer victory points based on combinations of resources, skills, and workers. The player with the most victory points at the end of the winter season wins the game.\n\n![Keyflower](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__itemrep/img/1l2Uipp2Xmu0rSHR3nYaEHQarMY=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2278942.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.
