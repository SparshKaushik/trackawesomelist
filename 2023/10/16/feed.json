You will promote and nurture Artists; buy, display, and sell their Art; and build and exert your international reputation. As a result, you will achieve the respect needed to draw visitors to your Gallery from all over the world.\n> There's a lot of work to be done, but don't worry, you can hire assistants to help you achieve your goals.

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.\n> During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located \"later\" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you – but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.\n\n![Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXf7mDyDYuHg6oe8yTUIEA__itemrep/img/8M-vck69HAdoJdStBZ8q91-7hRs=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4604439.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\n> The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.\n\n![Paladins of the West Kingdom game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__itemrep/img/2YT-EqfAb6vwxDSrFQMSm-luQAs=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4462987.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n> They allow a player to choose actions during the game.\n> They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.\n\n![Concordia Venus game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/36WIe0ZHkp5OvHOlB-8vog__itemrep/img/_lJIROiyeLhIZi7z9XO3Wt9w7wA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4356580.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.\n> Obsession is a game of 16 to 20 turns in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders' market, and manipulate an extensive service staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen utilizing a novel worker placement mechanic. Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player's wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.\n\n![Obsession game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__itemrep/img/_1IdpMxkMKCR0bx-7E8mbh3nqzM=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5902073.png)\n\n| Players | Min. Age |      Time |\n| ------: | -------: | --------: |\n|     1–4 |      14+ | 30–90 Min |\n### [Beyond the Sun](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/317985/beyond-the-sun)\n\n> Beyond the Sun is a space civilization game in which players collectively decide the technological progress of humankind at the dawn of the Spacefaring Era, while competing against each other to be the leading faction in economic development, science, and galactic influence.\n> The game is played over a variable number of rounds until a number of game-end achievements are collectively claimed by the players. The winner is the faction with the most victory points, which are obtained by researching technologies, improving their economy, controlling and colonizing systems, and completing various achievements and events throughout the game.\n> On a turn, a player moves their action pawn to an empty action space, then takes that action. They then conduct their production phase, either producing ore, growing their population, or trading one of those resources for another. Finally, they can claim up to one achievement, if possible.\n\n![Beyond the Sun game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BfEHqHQAvZLbRX7y7e9TWg__itemrep/img/kSw_dxGnXuq6trYpz7ob53-u2uU=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5617866.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

What are the rumors regarding the unknown planet about? The eventful journey through space extends over 50 exciting missions. But this game can only be defeated by meeting common individual tasks of each player. In order to meet the varied challenges communication is essential in the team. But this is more difficult than expected in space.\n> With each mission the game becomes more difficult. After each mission the game can be paused and continued later. During each mission it is not the number of tricks but the right tricks at the right time that count.\n> The team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.\n\n![The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__itemrep/img/etVRTXdF6IDsnGKQe77FRFP4H7M=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5687013.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.\n> Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!\n> The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:\n\n![Clans of Caledonia game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__itemrep/img/xxhvhwGExrMMiLD9lcsUvQoKxU8=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3511783.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.\n> There are ten missions in total, and each individual mission will take about 60-90 minutes. The box includes five game boards, four command lines (one for each player), four painted mech miniatures, ability and damage decks, a sand timer, a bomb-like-power source miniature, 6 metal trackers, 4 acrylic shards, 4 dice, and 100 minion miniatures. There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...\n\n![Mechs vs. Minions game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n4J5LebMj0DQD016qW7ABw__itemrep/img/httjWYSnwrB_d1pPomIftQATHMc=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3184103.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min. Age |       Time |\n| ------: | -------: | ---------: |\n|     2–4 |      14+ | 60–120 Min |\n### [Fields of Arle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159675/fields-of-arle)\n\n> Welcome to Arle\n> In Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town’s prosperity.\n> Work the Land\n> Whether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you’d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.\n\n![Fields of Arle game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__itemrep/img/d8By7I7jEh7VAduRxBrISS2qfnA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2225968.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.\n> After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.\n\n![Le Havre game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7Rqd3S6J7vyVhicR1bqTQ__itemrep/img/4Ks1jgI4QIqGjDjsOPIk9fJuLIE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6091101.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little café into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your café become the Grand Austria Hotel.\n> The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.\n\n![Grand Austria Hotel game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GlCmHjdLwv3SqSjv52ToGw__itemrep/img/Meb89u4vSn3xNl_2wJTF2TYXhr8=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6966955.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Only weeks or months pass for them, traveling at near-light speeds, but decades pass in the universe surrounding them. The enemy these units meet on the battlefield could be technologically decades ahead or behind them when the battle is joined.\n\n![The Forever War](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dy8ocrTp51HxcARd6Rha1A__itemrep/img/zpLHyvIy06wU44yNwx5LM6UVwDA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5722429.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.\nAfter every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves.
