Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.In addition to having the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven will feature much more to do outside of combat, such as numerous mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how this ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.Frosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanic for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as it is a remote location, these products get imported and are not there as standard. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buy them.\n\n![Frosthaven](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iEBr5o8AbJi9V9cgQcYROQ__itemrep/img/Z2XUvMkSdxK4qiewCLTJvUl41gA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6177719.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.
