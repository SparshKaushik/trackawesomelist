The dice you don't use are as important as those you do, because every die with a lower value than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times.\n\n![That's Pretty Clever! game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3-unuy5JW1cC8C6EUBNiOA__itemrep/img/6BcSS0mLm9nJBIXTcz0HQ5SKJmI=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4410877.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Portals transport you all around the dungeon depths. Wayshrines offer vast riches to intrepid explorers. Prisoners are counting on you to free them. Ghosts, once disturbed, may haunt you to death. Despite all that, it's time to leave the board behind with Clank! Catacombs, a standalone deck-building adventure.\n>\n> Each trip into the catacombs is unique since you lay tiles to create the dungeon. You can play using only the all-new dungeon deck, or you can include cards from previous Clank! expansions.\n>\n> Find your fortune (and escape the dragon!) in Clank! Catacombs.\n\n![Clank!: Catacombs game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cCLn9Mvb7jRSaZzHeUXhoQ__itemrep/img/A1D0c966kaxlKRgGMPakzgeupmU=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6937913.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.\n>\n> In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...\n\n![Istanbul game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__itemrep/img/3-96MTKIPtgjJ8inH9DWDxCf0no=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic1885326.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in !\n\n![Welcome To... game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4XmxyKhNVdhC3QPd1purQ__itemrep/img/QKJwfdV3Qrv9w2TX_ML5T3z5G9E=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3761012.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans — whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.\n>\n> In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.\n\n![Azul: Summer Pavilion game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/843kZ6WR0HfyXWEybA6L7A__itemrep/img/zOE89_4aCHOqoYITnbMSxAVR_UA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4930887.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Ragnarök has come, and it’s the end of the world! It’s the Vikings’ last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin’s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarök, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n> Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These “Gods’ Gifts” grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.\n\n![Blood Rage game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__itemrep/img/ZSJhCapvtPoiIQZ1XdfO-qgUuFY=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2439223.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min. Age |      Time |\n| ------: | -------: | --------: |\n|     2–4 |       14 | 60–90 Min |\n### [Puerto Rico](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076/puerto-rico)\n\n> In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n> Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n> The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\n![Puerto Rico game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__itemrep/img/YDEozo5DfKYdDp8xi2mAfoV2qWk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic158548.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Age |       Time |\n| ------: | -------: | ---------: |\n|     1–4 |       14 | 60–120 Min |\n### [Too Many Bones](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192135/too-many-bones)\n\n> Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG. This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head. Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous \"baddie\" responsible.\n> Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.\n\n![Too Many Bones game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wKwRk0wYBcrtLAfgn4PCdg__itemrep/img/xKVF_SqBoULptBCjVdvHmpdsP0o=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6624445.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Farmers and Boatmen supply you with money and goods; Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions; Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work; Scholars make progress in science; Traders open up new locations for you to use your followers; and last but not least, it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with Monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate.\n\n![Orléans game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nagl1li6kYt9elV9jbfVQw__itemrep/img/oYYWKekDiHllrWnFNef7En3gP4c=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6228507.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, but pieces can be promoted upon reaching the enemy's promotion zone. Shogi offers a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience with unique piece movements and captures. It is much more complex than international chess.\n\n![Shogi image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Shogi_Ban_Koma.jpg/250px-Shogi_Ban_Koma.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.\n> Combatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.\n\n![Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y0x1zbkpUXjddzWWnhekYw__itemrep/img/jkXL5CPHgbwGPoahpK73KV7ohJA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5581457.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?\n> The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof.

Western histories often call this period \"The Great Game\" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\n> In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.\n\n![Pax Pamir: Second Edition game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__itemrep/img/4yTV5vAsuDi8MZP6wWysZA8tmQg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4503733.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.\n> You will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with \"kanban\" (看板) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process. Over the course of the game, players take on the role of rookie employees who are trying to secure their career. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.\n\n![Kanban EV game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L2Wn-zUqkcHgqvwvY212Ig__itemrep/img/S_mg665DznHuiuvxvOIPk2mYwHM=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4924232.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's \"A-cards\"; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.\n\n![Underwater Cities game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__itemrep/img/CHpbozXB266LtImU0nze5uXJ-HI=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4837710.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n> The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n> Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\n\n![Viticulture Essential Edition game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l_PRU2lVlX9seScRFcvFlA__itemrep/img/rfRBuKUlSgnnNpbRfy_osB9xrsM=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6500949.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n> It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm.

The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city.

This game is also seen in southern India with a different board, but the rules are same. The game is played on a 5×5 point grid. Pieces are positioned at the intersection of the lines. Gameplay takes place in two phases. In the first phase the goats are placed on the board while the tigers are moved. In the second phase both the tigers and the goats are moved. For the tigers the goal is to capture five goats to win. A goat can be captured by jumping over it, although capturing is not obligatory. The goats win by blocking all of tiger's leagal moves.\n\n![Bagh Chal image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Brass_goat_tiger_game_board.jpg/250px-Brass_goat_tiger_game_board.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Everything goes well at the beginning when they calmly agree on the same amount of candies for each of them, but soon they come up with more and more ideas and a debate starts… the Pig says,“Those who weigh over 10kg should get an extra candy!”... the Dog says, “Whoever oversleeps should return a candy to the pool!” To resolve their hectic argument, they finally decide to form the House of Pets, at which the animal councilors will discuss proposals and vote on new laws. Who can get the most delicious candies in this exciting voting game? Based on Karl-Heinz Schmiel's Das Regeln Wir Schon, players attempt to pass laws which benefit themselves. The laws are either immediate or semi-permanent, and they can have all kinds of different effects: all players with beards get five points, vote cards must be played with the left hand, or some sort of re-evaluation or redistribution of the chips that each player has. The chips are the main way that players score, but their worth fluctuates constantly.

For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarök, the ultimate inescapable doom.\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These “Gods’ Gifts” grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__itemrep/img/ZSJhCapvtPoiIQZ1XdfO-qgUuFY=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic2439223.jpg\" alt=\"Blood Rage game image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.\nCombatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y0x1zbkpUXjddzWWnhekYw__itemrep/img/jkXL5CPHgbwGPoahpK73KV7ohJA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic5581457.jpg\" alt=\"Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 game image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?\nThe game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__itemrep/img/DzC9cA0TNmWUO7WLdl4-uFHfO_k=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg\" alt=\"Agricola game image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

Western histories often call this period \"The Great Game\" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\nIn terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__itemrep/img/4yTV5vAsuDi8MZP6wWysZA8tmQg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png\" alt=\"Pax Pamir: Second Edition game image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\nFortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them.

You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\nIt's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm.

On a turn, the active player reads one question to the other players, who then collectively decide on a numerical answer for that question. The reader must then state whether the answer given is too high, too low, or exactly right. If the reader guesses wrong, he removes the card from the game and the next player chooses the next question; if he guessed \"over\" or \"under\" and was right, he keeps the card, then passes the deck; if he guessed \"exactly right\" and was right, he keeps the card, then reads the next question himself. Bonus! When the stack of cards runs out, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kpbFiqdQ-yeKNEooopuBQg__itemrep/img/77MAMlhpObiRmNnl0b3CtHZycsQ=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic1950463.jpg\" alt=\"Over/Under image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.
