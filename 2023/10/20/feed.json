Warri, Oh-Wah-Ree, Kalah) and more traditional Checkers-like games. It is played by four players according to the original rules, but can be adapted to be played by just two (the three-player game would be unbalanced).The 6x6 board is surrounded by Mancala-like pits, where pebbles are moved. The number of pebbles in a row/column/diagonal's pits controls how the pawns on the board move.Two sets of rules are supplied: the Alignment game, where you are trying to be the first to align four of your pawns in any six-space row --either horizontally, vertically or diagonally-- without opposing pawns between them, and the more advanced Capture game, where you're trying to capture your opponents' key pawns (kings, really).\n\n![Contigo](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B2P9bmgJlL87px1_mbSX6g__itemrep/img/6jfkcejPAXdZCyEClQGQtwWLUxQ=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4084792.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money – acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige – while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.\n\n![Bruxelles 1893](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sDga04VbcuQdapSSJme-Tg__itemrep/img/aui_nJkuW72phCvPezxpp5Pnw7M=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic1726346.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccolò Machiavelli published his masterpiece \"The Prince,\" backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3–4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.\n\n![Here I Stand](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SaJz1vt6j4njvkhDaplSHA__itemrep/img/28KXJz7JsY47i1eKS6TRY_elzYg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic353047.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The most prestigious base will become the new lunar capital!\n> The game employs the familiar \"pick & pass\" or \"hand drafting\" mechanism for players to select a new structure cards to add to their base. Each hand of cards represents a convoy of experts and equipment travelling between the players' outposts, giving the player the choice of one new construction each turn. In a new twist on the genre, each hand always contains one of a number of \"Expedition\" cards that grant a special free action every turn before passing on to the next player.Wooden lunar rover tokens are a neutral resource that add a worker placement element to the game. They are also used to break ties and so must be used with care.\n> Over the three distinct eras of the game, players compete for majority in 5 aspects of their bases: housing, transportation, science, industry, and food production. At the end of each era, the leader in each of these areas as determined by flag icons on their constructed buildings, collects bonus victory points.\n\n![Moon](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5S4mv0txfpPBtvttcOThUg__itemrep/img/tDaLiIY58rhlKzdvCnfxf31QTZ0=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6742326.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!

During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.The central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimio to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.With accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups.

As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials.\n> Simultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima’s central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.\n> Rescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players’ coven can end up in yours.\n> Accessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games’ most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Villő Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bernát, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms. It is very quick to teach and set up, and takes less than 2 hours to play, even with four players.\n\n![Septima](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRKbAxjXO8m6IA7ifrI5o_Q7mP24Lh2lxrYg\\&usqp=CAU)\n\n| Players | Min.

Income on the old planet shrinks over time, and production probably won't be much better until you establish yourself on the new planet and kick things into action. Resources can't be mixed across the planets, so you need to take special care with your planning.To do this, you choose actions from the player board, with the expert variant adding cards to your hand that allow you to choose additional actions and combine them. Each action has its own value, and the sum of these actions is important for an \"end of the round\" bonus. Additionally, players move their markers along the orbital track based on the value of their actions.If you can raise production of three resources to level 8 and have three virtual reality machines on the new planet, you win.\n\n![Evacuation](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQH6tyBr_kCApC4rO4jy0iT7lwN2k-9Jc-YZO-j9L6sDnYWeDKhsymhytJihS8Dfd60ujY\\&usqp=CAU)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each turn is split into three phases, the guardian animal phase, the action phase, and attacks by Onibi. In the guardian phase, players draw guardian animal cards to form help lines using a push-your-luck mechanism.The action phase is split into actions that players may perform depending on the symbols on their help line, including gaining fragment tiles, attracting guardian animals, extinguishing a fire, moving on the Circle of Spirits board, or placing a protective tree. However, the strengths of the actions vary depending on symbols on guardian animal cards. For example, players may only extinguish fires for which they have fire symbols. After the action phase, the players have to take penalty cards to their own discard pile, a tree is attacked, and guardian animals are altered. Once a player reaches one of the game thresholds, including planting 12 trees, extinguishing 12 fires or gaining 12 flower symbols, the player ending the game wins.\n\n![Living Forest](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fPhdfZX9UTLr4-SVgK0zoQ__itemrep/img/GkBRKg9Bx3YA5cciuNivpAul7V0=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5899025.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The game later also spread to as far as Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is played by two players, with a wooden board that has fourteen pits in all. There have been several variations in the layout of the pits, one among them being seven pits on each player's side. The pits contain cowry shells, seeds or small pebbles used as counters. It is played on a rectangular board with two rows and seven columns. 12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction. If, after having acounter dropped into it, a counter contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped it. The round is over when no counters remain.\n\n![Pallanguzhi](https://rukminim2.flixcart.com/image/416/416/jvmpci80/board-game/m/h/k/pallankuzhi-with-shells-and-box-jayam-original-imafggugzjk5q7yb.jpeg?q=70)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money – acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige – while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand.

At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.The central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimio to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.With accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups.

As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials.\nSimultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima’s central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.\nRescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players’ coven can end up in yours.\nAccessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games’ most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Villő Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bernát, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms. It is very quick to teach and set up, and takes less than 2 hours to play, even with four players.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRKbAxjXO8m6IA7ifrI5o_Q7mP24Lh2lxrYg&amp;usqp=CAU\" alt=\"Septima\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

Each turn is split into three phases, the guardian animal phase, the action phase, and attacks by Onibi. In the guardian phase, players draw guardian animal cards to form help lines using a push-your-luck mechanism.The action phase is split into actions that players may perform depending on the symbols on their help line, including gaining fragment tiles, attracting guardian animals, extinguishing a fire, moving on the Circle of Spirits board, or placing a protective tree. However, the strengths of the actions vary depending on symbols on guardian animal cards. For example, players may only extinguish fires for which they have fire symbols. After the action phase, the players have to take penalty cards to their own discard pile, a tree is attacked, and guardian animals are altered. Once a player reaches one of the game thresholds, including planting 12 trees, extinguishing 12 fires or gaining 12 flower symbols, the player ending the game wins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fPhdfZX9UTLr4-SVgK0zoQ__itemrep/img/GkBRKg9Bx3YA5cciuNivpAul7V0=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic5899025.jpg\" alt=\"Living Forest\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

The game later also spread to as far as Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is played by two players, with a wooden board that has fourteen pits in all. There have been several variations in the layout of the pits, one among them being seven pits on each player's side. The pits contain cowry shells, seeds or small pebbles used as counters. It is played on a rectangular board with two rows and seven columns. 12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction. If, after having acounter dropped into it, a counter contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped it. The round is over when no counters remain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://rukminim2.flixcart.com/image/416/416/jvmpci80/board-game/m/h/k/pallankuzhi-with-shells-and-box-jayam-original-imafggugzjk5q7yb.jpeg?q=70\" alt=\"Pallanguzhi\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.
