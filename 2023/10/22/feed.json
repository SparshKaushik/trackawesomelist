By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game. The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.\n\n> Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.\n\n![Caylus game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__itemrep/img/jVFZ85jsjJHQUXlImoDptZcENP8=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic1638795.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Tolkien's iconic world with The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth, a fully co-operative, app-supported board game for one to five players! You'll battle villainous foes, make courageous choices, and strike a blow against the evil that threatens the land — all as part of a thrilling campaign that leads you across the storied hills and dales of Middle-Earth.\n>\n> Each individual game of Journeys in Middle-Earth is a single adventure in a larger campaign. You'll explore the vast and dynamic landscapes of Middle-earth, using your skills to survive the challenges that you encounter on these perilous quests. As you and your fellow heroes explore the wilderness and battle the dark forces arrayed against you, the game's companion app guides you to reveal the looming forests, quiet clearings, and ancient halls of Middle-Earth, while also controlling the enemies you encounter. Whether you're venturing into the wild on your own or with close companions by your side, you can write your own legend in the history of Middle-Earth.\n\n![The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1XA2-niwTBa0HEB7hOz3Dw__itemrep/img/_ITP3pPZx-TQoUYwXoBOLvUboSw=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4530974.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.\n\n![Arkham ](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__itemrep/img/d7sT40CRGgKcClC_UjTlanbRrUU=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic175966.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players move through rooms and entryways to eliminate zombies and keep the zombie reserve full. If a zombie must enter the school but none are available, then the school has been overrun and the players lose. To win the game, players need to lock each of the four entryways as apparently the custodian has abandoned the post and given up the school for lost. As players get better, they can complete missions, track their development through a trophy-sticker system reminiscent of video games, and open envelopes that contain new material for the game, upping the challenge they face while also providing them with new powers and new heroes as well.\n\n![zombie kidz evolution](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Iwv0Vg8FXIKlEr8xKsapIQ__itemrep/img/arIztf26YRobgCtw60KgI_pmH8k=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4334067.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

You will earn money and prestige by building the biggest and most profitable casinos on \"The Strip,\" the town's backbone of dust and sin. You start with nothing but parking lots and dreams, but from there you build, sprawl, reorganize and gamble your way to victory. Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!.The game board is broken into 6 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money. Ultimately, though, only points matter, and that means making yourself boss of the biggest casinos.\n\n![Lords Of Vegas](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-uYn413Wy8Vzm9wkuOajWg__itemrep/img/cxNjgjWpiQ3ATxJ6rShTlMYYzpk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic774410.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The first The Avalon Hill Game Co version has perhaps the widest release, but Avalon Hill re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces. In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.In the game, players represent one of the seven \"Great Powers of Europe\" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \"orders.\" The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.\n\n![Diplomacy](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CGJihifkrZSqW40zElgXkQ__itemrep/img/_dNaGO1i21OAbqm74ng6LkhOG8o=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic7376874.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The players explore the islands of South America, secure trading routes, and build settlements.The actions available to players are determined through the use of a specialized cube tower, which has appeared in the Queen titles Im Zeichen des Kreuzes and Wallenstein. At the start of the game, this tower is seeded with action cubes, which come in seven colors, with each color matching a particular type of action. During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower – but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free. Thus, players need to play both tactically – taking advantage of the actions currently available in the best way possible – and strategically – using their knowledge of which actions do what to play well over the course of the game.The game board is composed of nine, twelve or sixteen tiles, depending on the number of players. Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points. Players might want to invest in cannons to protect themselves from pirates roaming the waters or acquire progress tokens to gain special advantages.\n\n![Amerigo](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CPTCRbcUGvW-gepKwTvjSg__itemrep/img/f-hyime0OFz0aZNowaIxDKxt2fM=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic1824151.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

With an ever-expanding array of kingdom cards representing economic, military, and political facets, players craft their decks to conquer provinces and accumulate victory points. The game's modular design ensures endless strategic permutations, challenging players to navigate the delicate balance between growth and defense. In the end, Dominion is not just a game of cards; it's a dynamic journey through the complexities of empire-building, where each decision influences the rise or fall of your dominion.\n\n![Dominion](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6iQpZ4XkemZP07HNCODBA__itemrep/img/_QiaiFj-LGZoqdatE-wVqNaYWx8=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic394356.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The second edition of Nemo's War, Victory Point Games' popular solitaire offering from designer Chris Taylor, is a greatly enhanced offering featuring mass-production printing and amazing Ian O'Toole art and graphics throughout.

The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.\n\n![Imperial Settlers](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRwsvyfsRJ-lWWwVJCdXNg__itemrep/img/fTfXILZ-2FIy12vUC3Fxix3RmzY=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2871265.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of the galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship. During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one of the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety. The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.\n\n![Space Alert](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__itemrep/img/BOGa_tAkG2aSoCtTlarj2JY4O3A=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic384313.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

It's easy to learn and takes 10-20 minutes to play.\n> The game is simple. Be the last koala alive and win the game\n> Play cards from your hand and end your turn by drawing a card.

Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino's owner.

Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \"orders.\" The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of the galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship. During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one of the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety. The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__itemrep/img/BOGa_tAkG2aSoCtTlarj2JY4O3A=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic384313.jpg\" alt=\"Space Alert\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.
