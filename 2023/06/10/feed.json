A comment on HN details the [questions that were highly correlated to company success](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20571219).\n\n### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral\n\n*   [Intellectual Humility Cheat Sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526135036/https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53419b80e4b0cccdfc3bbcf8/1579371627532-SANUEQ1REPX09L8NE1XM/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kI9Q46LYBJG1wKj9b7EvhSB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmWp-RWlGnWD_Yv5axNBE_gjfhPXbI2t7MOi3WVleCqN9URFC-c33mY-I6dtTBVWXC/ih-cheat-sheet-v2.jpg) - “is about being open and able to change your mind about important things, and being able to discern when you should.”\n\n### Team Dynamics / Behavioral\n\n*   [Symptoms of Groupthink](https://web.archive.org/web/20210925184712/https://courses.washington.edu/psii101/Powerpoints/Symptoms%20of%20Groupthink.htm) - Overconfidence, tunnel vision and conformity pressure can led a group astray.\n\n### Engineering / The Technical Engineering Manager\n\n*   “Over the years we have developed the policy that it is important for the supervisor to thoroughly know and understand the work of his group.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20683609)) - This quote is [from David Packard](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Way-Hewlett-Built-Company/dp/0887307477?_encoding=UTF8\\&qid=1686404404\\&sr=1-1\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=e6069674f9b0b4ef884b0f8f70eb8f94\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (HP co-founder), decades before current [management fad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_fad).\n\n### Engineering / Systems Complexity\n\n*   [Living with Complexity, by Donald A. Norman](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Complexity-Donald-Norman-2010/dp/B00DEKM5GK?_encoding=UTF8\\&qid=1686404524\\&sr=1-1\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=497ae387bbd398624d897bdfbf90f7b6\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) - In which we learn that, based on [Tesler's law of the conservation of complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity), “the total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person's interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex.”\n*   [The Efficiency-Destroying Magic of Tidying Up](https://flocrivello.com/the-efficiency-destroying-magic-of-tidying-up/) - “Efficiency tends to look messy, and good looks tend to be inefficient.” A reminder that sometimes we should just accept [the messiness of the world (⭐26k)](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood).\n\n### Engineering / Engineering Practices\n\n*   [How to Misuse Code Coverage](https://web.archive.org/web/20180508120159/http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Marick_coverage.pdf) - “If a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it's likely also weak in a way coverage can't detect.” I.e. the great benefit of a coverage report is that it tells you what you forgot to think about when you wrote the test suite itself ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28678098)).\n\n### Engineering / Technical Debt\n\n*   [The Framing of the Developer](https://www.amazingcto.com/develop-for-impact-not-for-backlog/) - Default framing is around the backlog, which leads to an asymmetry in which failure is blamed on lacks of developer performance, and success is celebrated as the full realization of the PM's vision. But “technology is the bank that gave credit”, and technical debt should be called product debt “because product took the credit to get a feature faster and must pay back by investing the time to clean up.” The alternative? “Companies today need a frame of impact. In this world-view success is defined by impact.”\n\n### Meetings / Standups\n\n*   [Your daily standups should be async.

Berard - [Essays on object-oriented software engineering](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0132888955?\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=559e579e5b00fde12559bbbb91ec1b95\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).\n*   [The art of destroying software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed94CfxgsCA) - Greg Young described a good way to deal with requirements volatility: optimize from the beginning to be able to delete your code, and structure your code so that any part of it is no bigger than 1 week's worth of coding. So that any part can be re-written in 1 week.\n\n### Key Performance Indicator (KPI) / Delivery\n\n*   “Numerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.” - [W. Edwards Deming](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Crisis-W-Edwards-Deming/dp/0911379010?_encoding=UTF8\\&qid=\\&sr=\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=ec7a442a2cd5bfcfb5b6c32ea1409f2f\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)\n\n### Communication / Reading\n\n*   [How to Read a Paper](http://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/papers/07/paper-reading.pdf) - Outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers.\n\n### Communication / Presentations\n\n*   [Presentation Rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720230551/http://www.jilles.net/perma/2020/06/05/presentation-rules.html) - A set of 16 rules to avoid boring and ineffective presentations, and have your message reach your audience.\n\n### Politics / Equity\n\n*   [The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0140280197?\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=bf129d7f7a3495a445cf2bf667d3d3c6\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) - By Robert Greene.
