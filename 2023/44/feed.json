This can be in various forms such as text, images, sounds, or other datasets. This data serves as the foundational material that the AI uses to recognize and understand patterns.\n*   **Training the AI**: With the data in hand, the next step is 'training'. During this phase, the AI processes the data multiple times to learn and internalize the patterns present. The outcome of this stage is a 'model', which acts like a digital representation of the knowledge derived from the data.\n*   **Fine-Tuning**: At times, there's a need for the AI to focus on specific nuances or characteristics. In such cases, an additional set of data is used to 'fine-tune' the already trained model, enhancing its capabilities in the desired direction.\n*   **Using the Model**: After training, the model is prepared to make inferences, which means using its acquired knowledge to process new data and come up with relevant outputs. This inference process can be executed locally on a machine or can be accessed remotely through an 'API'. The choice between local execution and API access often depends on factors like computational resources, application needs, and user preferences. Whether locally or via an API, the goal is to leverage the model's capabilities to derive meaningful results from new data inputs.\n*   **Generating New Data**: With the model set up, the AI can now produce or 'generate' new data. By giving the AI certain 'input parameters' or guidelines, it returns with 'generated output', which is the newly created content.\n*   **Applications**: The output generated by the AI can be incorporated into a range of applications, be it websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms. The 'interface' refers to the user-facing portion of these applications, enabling users to interact with and benefit from the AI's capabilities.\n\n### Generative AI Tools Directories\n\n*   [The Generative AI Landscape](https://ai-collection.org/): \"a collection of awesome generative AI applications\"\n*   [The ultimate list of AI tools for creators | Descript](https://www.descript.com/blog/article/the-ultimate-list-of-ai-tools-for-creators): collection organized by Descript\n\n### Roadmaps, Tracks, Rails / Deforum\n\n*   \\[🔥🔥] [Generative AI for Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/#/): introductory 12 lesson course by Microsoft\n*   [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youssef-hosni-b2960b135_if-you-want-to-start-studying-generative-activity-7125908710702350336-vhsm/): series of Medium articles by Youssef Hosni\n\n### Courses and Educational Materials\n\n*   [Animated AI](https://animatedai.github.io/): animations and instructional videos about neural networks\n*   [Deep Learning AI - Learn the fundamentals of generative AI for real-world applications](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/): created in partnership with AWS, this course presents the fundamentals of how generative AI works and how to deploy it in real-world applications.\n*   [Google Cloud Skills Boost - Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/536): an introductory level microlearning course covering Google Tools aimed at explaining what Generative AI is, how it is used, and how it differs from traditional machine learning methods.\n*   [Google Cloud Skills Boost: Generative AI learning path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/journeys/118): curated content on Generative AI \"from the fundamentals of Large Language Models to how to create and deploy generative AI solutions on Google Cloud\"\n*   [AI for Industrial Design](https://industrialdesign.ai/): \"students at the National University of Singapore explore AI’s capability for design in a semester course and share what they learned.

This can be in various forms such as text, images, sounds, or other datasets. This data serves as the foundational material that the AI uses to recognize and understand patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Training the AI</strong>: With the data in hand, the next step is 'training'. During this phase, the AI processes the data multiple times to learn and internalize the patterns present. The outcome of this stage is a 'model', which acts like a digital representation of the knowledge derived from the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong>: At times, there's a need for the AI to focus on specific nuances or characteristics. In such cases, an additional set of data is used to 'fine-tune' the already trained model, enhancing its capabilities in the desired direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using the Model</strong>: After training, the model is prepared to make inferences, which means using its acquired knowledge to process new data and come up with relevant outputs. This inference process can be executed locally on a machine or can be accessed remotely through an 'API'. The choice between local execution and API access often depends on factors like computational resources, application needs, and user preferences. Whether locally or via an API, the goal is to leverage the model's capabilities to derive meaningful results from new data inputs.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generating New Data</strong>: With the model set up, the AI can now produce or 'generate' new data. By giving the AI certain 'input parameters' or guidelines, it returns with 'generated output', which is the newly created content.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applications</strong>: The output generated by the AI can be incorporated into a range of applications, be it websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms. The 'interface' refers to the user-facing portion of these applications, enabling users to interact with and benefit from the AI's capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Generative AI Tools Directories</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ai-collection.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Generative AI Landscape</a>: \"a collection of awesome generative AI applications\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.descript.com/blog/article/the-ultimate-list-of-ai-tools-for-creators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The ultimate list of AI tools for creators | Descript</a>: collection organized by Descript</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Roadmaps, Tracks, Rails / Deforum</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li>[🔥🔥] <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/#/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Generative AI for Beginners</a>: introductory 12 lesson course by Microsoft</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youssef-hosni-b2960b135_if-you-want-to-start-studying-generative-activity-7125908710702350336-vhsm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Introduction to Generative AI</a>: series of Medium articles by Youssef Hosni</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Courses and Educational Materials</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://animatedai.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Animated AI</a>: animations and instructional videos about neural networks</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deep Learning AI - Learn the fundamentals of generative AI for real-world applications</a>: created in partnership with AWS, this course presents the fundamentals of how generative AI works and how to deploy it in real-world applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/536\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud Skills Boost - Introduction to Generative AI</a>: an introductory level microlearning course covering Google Tools aimed at explaining what Generative AI is, how it is used, and how it differs from traditional machine learning methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/journeys/118\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud Skills Boost: Generative AI learning path</a>: curated content on Generative AI \"from the fundamentals of Large Language Models to how to create and deploy generative AI solutions on Google Cloud\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://industrialdesign.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI for Industrial Design</a>: \"students at the National University of Singapore explore AI’s capability for design in a semester course and share what they learned.

Well, imagine a dozen or so random humans, robots, and none-of-the-aboves, each with their own abilities, goals, and secret relationships, have been turned loose on a space station that is going to be incinerated upon its inevitable reentry into Earth's atmosphere. You are one of these characters, and the others are collaborators you have on hand ready to assist you in achieving your goals. But choose them wisely, as any one of them could secretly be another player waiting to betray you!\n>\n> *   Stationfall is a box full of creative solutions, but that box is going to morph, twist, and grow teeth over the course of play. Your best turns will exploit the unique tactical freedom of being a secret conspiracy, as well as deductions about your opponents’ identities and motives. Stationfall is messy, intricate, and full of dangerous variables.\n\n![Stationfall game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eUiju5SqZbkNt8gnEofrTw__itemrep/img/lpTPPEk14XV1RzIhRYVIWNHD0I4=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6035127.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

The game can be played by two to four players, with the objective being to enter and exit both pieces strategically. Players use cowrie shells to determine movement. If a player lands on an opponent's piece, it's sent off the board for re-entry, except on 'crosscut' spaces, where pieces remain safe.\n\n![Ashtapada game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kg1eP5Vdj6LoFqQ2E2Kxew__opengraph/img/lykEixPPGFGql26yrwEYvhj3XMo=/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic55539.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The board is made of wool or cloth, with wooden pawns and seven cowry shells to be used to determine each player's move, although others distinguish chaupur from pachisi by the use of three four-sided long dice. Variations are played throughout India. It is similar in some ways to Pachisi, Parcheesi and Ludo. In most of the villages of India, this game is played by old people.\n\n![Chaupar image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Chopat.jpg/330px-Chopat.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The roles are kept secret until the end of the round. As miners, they are hunting for gold. The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try to be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n>\n> The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed face-down onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which. Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, they must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass. Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself.\n>\n> Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards. Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and would receive cards with gold pieces as their reward. The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and would receive the gold pieces.\n>\n> After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\n![Saboteur](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0vJwP6NGa7GHPZKC3gplUw__itemrep/img/aJcXGhYr8XxyKEK6EqbG0bePrOk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3989824.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Presumably, this wild government would be built upon the support of fellow creatures and fueled by the fame, attention, and prestige of wide-eyed visitors. Naturally, the most aspirational beasts would lobby for a position in the star exhibit, and the lead star would be elected Zoo Mascot.In order to join the star exhibit, each species must campaign its way up the hierarchy of enclosures with the majority support of animal voters. And the lead star will be the species that has earned the most laurels from both raving fans and jealous rivals along the way. How does one gain support and earn laurels? Through crafty politicking, clever negotiations, and ruthless schemes. There can only be one Zoo Mascot, after all. Where are you going? That is the ultimate question of Zoo Vadis.\n>\n> Zoo Vadis is an evolution of Reiner Knizia’s classic negotiation game, Quo Vadis? It retains the elegant, political gameplay that fans have come to love while introducing many innovations and improvements by: a) Enhancing the 3-player game and tailoring the board to all player counts through neutral, bribable figures—roaming peacocks, b) Widening the player count with a second game board for 6-7 players, c) Expanding the possibilities for strategic negotiation with asymmetric animal abilities, d) Increasing tactical opportunities with new special laurel tokens, e) Broadening the appeal of the theme and presentation with vibrant zoo art by Kwanchai Moriya and Brigette Indelicato, f) Enlivening the production with chunky animal figures and functional player screens.\n>\n> Like the original design, the game ends immediately when the Star Exhibit is full. Only the animals who have reached the Star Exhibit qualify for victory, and the winner is the player with the most laurels.\n\n![Zoo Vadis](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Kl3NjtNKpuJNPjdBQtdsow__itemrep/img/mmVsnLtn3T4zkeNbjWpfrWZKS5c=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6988937.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The aftermath was tragedy and petty conflict in equal measure, a time of loss and exhaustion. In the ensuing Dark Years, the factions of the galaxy retreated and recovered their strength. Now, they look upon the stars and see an opportunity—a chance to reclaim what was lost. A chance to redefine galactic civilization. A chance to leave their mark upon the stars.\n> Twilight Inscription, an epic roll-and-write game for one to eight players, offers an experience unlike anything Fantasy Flight Games has done before. With a limited pool of resources at your disposal, you’ll need to carefully manage Navigation, Expansion, Industry, and Warfare as you amass victory points and earn your right to the throne on Mecatol Rex.

Presumably, this wild government would be built upon the support of fellow creatures and fueled by the fame, attention, and prestige of wide-eyed visitors. Naturally, the most aspirational beasts would lobby for a position in the star exhibit, and the lead star would be elected Zoo Mascot.In order to join the star exhibit, each species must campaign its way up the hierarchy of enclosures with the majority support of animal voters. And the lead star will be the species that has earned the most laurels from both raving fans and jealous rivals along the way. How does one gain support and earn laurels? Through crafty politicking, clever negotiations, and ruthless schemes. There can only be one Zoo Mascot, after all. Where are you going? That is the ultimate question of Zoo Vadis.</p>\n<p>Zoo Vadis is an evolution of Reiner Knizia’s classic negotiation game, Quo Vadis? It retains the elegant, political gameplay that fans have come to love while introducing many innovations and improvements by: a) Enhancing the 3-player game and tailoring the board to all player counts through neutral, bribable figures—roaming peacocks, b) Widening the player count with a second game board for 6-7 players, c) Expanding the possibilities for strategic negotiation with asymmetric animal abilities, d) Increasing tactical opportunities with new special laurel tokens, e) Broadening the appeal of the theme and presentation with vibrant zoo art by Kwanchai Moriya and Brigette Indelicato, f) Enlivening the production with chunky animal figures and functional player screens.</p>\n<p>Like the original design, the game ends immediately when the Star Exhibit is full. Only the animals who have reached the Star Exhibit qualify for victory, and the winner is the player with the most laurels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Kl3NjtNKpuJNPjdBQtdsow__itemrep/img/mmVsnLtn3T4zkeNbjWpfrWZKS5c=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic6988937.jpg\" alt=\"Zoo Vadis\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

The aftermath was tragedy and petty conflict in equal measure, a time of loss and exhaustion. In the ensuing Dark Years, the factions of the galaxy retreated and recovered their strength. Now, they look upon the stars and see an opportunity—a chance to reclaim what was lost. A chance to redefine galactic civilization. A chance to leave their mark upon the stars.\nTwilight Inscription, an epic roll-and-write game for one to eight players, offers an experience unlike anything Fantasy Flight Games has done before. With a limited pool of resources at your disposal, you’ll need to carefully manage Navigation, Expansion, Industry, and Warfare as you amass victory points and earn your right to the throne on Mecatol Rex. Will your faction become the new rulers of the galaxy? Or will your fledgling empire fade into obscurity? Anything can happen in this strategic, infinitely-replayable game!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g36va6ofPCzNZXF-9GEpCg__itemrep/img/V3Cny2dR0eXaJjFkqkOCOoKP9Tg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic7132023.png\" alt=\"Twilight Inscription\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.
