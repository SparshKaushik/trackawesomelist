This new adventure takes your crew deep down into the abyss on a search for the fabled sunken land. How far you get depends entirely on how well you work together as a team. Card by card, trick by trick, your search party will discover the challenges that lie ahead and forge a path to Mu.\n>\n> This new version of The Crew has the same innovative co-operative trick-taking mechanism as the highly lauded original game — but with some exciting new surprises! While communication between your crew members is severely limited by your submerged state, it is also critical to your success; finding the hidden land in the murky depths depends not only on winning tricks, but also on carefully negotiating the order in which they are won. If things don't go as planned, you might just be able to salvage the operation, but it will take near flawless execution and perhaps a little luck to finally reach Mu.\n\n![The Crew: Mission Deep Sea game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__itemrep/img/tgB3g7PECxG14yQ0FkMiMaXaOFE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5988903.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The dice you don't use are as important as those you do, because every die with a lower value than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times.\n\n![That's Pretty Clever! game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3-unuy5JW1cC8C6EUBNiOA__itemrep/img/6BcSS0mLm9nJBIXTcz0HQ5SKJmI=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4410877.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

It's designed by Elizabeth Hargrave and features over 170 birds illustrated by Beth Sobel, Natalia Rojas, and Ana Maria Martinez.\n>\n> You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your network of wildlife preserves. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth:\n>\n> *   Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower\n> *   Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors\n\n![Wingspan game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yLZJCVLlIx4c7eJEWUNJ7w__itemrep/img/DR7181wU4sHT6gn6Q1XccpPxNHg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4458123.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Portals transport you all around the dungeon depths. Wayshrines offer vast riches to intrepid explorers. Prisoners are counting on you to free them. Ghosts, once disturbed, may haunt you to death. Despite all that, it's time to leave the board behind with Clank! Catacombs, a standalone deck-building adventure.\n>\n> Each trip into the catacombs is unique since you lay tiles to create the dungeon. You can play using only the all-new dungeon deck, or you can include cards from previous Clank! expansions.\n>\n> Find your fortune (and escape the dragon!) in Clank! Catacombs.\n\n![Clank!: Catacombs game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cCLn9Mvb7jRSaZzHeUXhoQ__itemrep/img/A1D0c966kaxlKRgGMPakzgeupmU=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6937913.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island's secrets.\n>\n> Lost Ruins of Arnak combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?\n\n![Lost Ruins of Arnak game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__itemrep/img/ETni1QwddAVjM-xLhciF0UM0FxQ=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5674958.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.\n>\n> In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...\n\n![Istanbul game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__itemrep/img/3-96MTKIPtgjJ8inH9DWDxCf0no=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic1885326.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host—you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?\n>\n> Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.\n>\n> On their turn a player can take one of three actions:\n\n![Everdell game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fjE7V5LNq31yVEW_yuqI-Q__itemrep/img/nyVhVuXdmw-1sigbocTKG81UInM=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3918905.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board. Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn.\n>\n> As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.\n\n![Crokinole game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7ejbxsn-UtLl3ehamuAEdw__itemrep/img/5OXvXz34AnlF9eCXZtNFMJ89JNc=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic79413.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in !\n\n![Welcome To... game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4XmxyKhNVdhC3QPd1purQ__itemrep/img/QKJwfdV3Qrv9w2TX_ML5T3z5G9E=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic3761012.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available — unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.\n\n![Cascadia game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MjeJZfulbsM1DSV3DrGJYA__itemrep/img/RjD03wEf_LoX0EF4DhnW6f0xNHU=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic5100691.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Selecting the right upgrades for their car will help them hug the curves and keep their engine cool enough to maintain top speeds. Ultimately, their driving skills will be the key to victory!\n>\n> Drivers can compete in a single race or use the \"Championship System\" to play a whole season in one game night, customizing their car before each race to claim the top spot of the podium. They have to be careful as the weather, road conditions, and events will change every race to spice up their championship. Players can also enjoy a solo mode with the Legends Module or add automated drivers as additional opponents in multiplayer games.\n\n![Heat: Pedal to the Metal game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-vOrd4bOspibyohYExLqWg__itemrep/img/mSj0nZUY3ofhIXFZJLGzF-6MQTg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6940449.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each player assembles and equips their own team, hiring various helpers from the scout to the scientist to the aborigine. All of them have one goal in mind: Reaching the golden border first and winning all of the riches for themselves. Whoever chooses the best tactics will be rewarded!\n\n![The Quest for El Dorado game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GLXfUI72Qph2136CxWIJww__itemrep/img/dD5tKXielG7vTwuJWeyv2PmVsds=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic7648372.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!\n>\n> Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will be worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!\n>\n> At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots. But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins — not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.\n\n![The Quacks of Quedlinburg game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pH5LgRL4mNRon-2NsSDb1Q__itemrep/img/qe9ywOTxtPr_n4DoXZgEY-C2qU0=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6137509.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.\n\n![SCOUT game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cf0xxkevbwTGF3VUZymKjg__itemrep/img/SBOXfC-WOg_Iko_2lHw3VMymsow=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6398727.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Take Gem and Pearl tokens from the common board, then purchase cards, gather bonuses, royal favours, and prestige.\n>\n> Discover new twists and strategic opportunities derived from Splendor, the original best-selling game. Acquire cards with impressive powers, take advantage of special Privileges, and fight over scarce access to Pearls.\n>\n> Splendor Duel is a two-player only standalone game based on Splendor that retains some of the main gameplay mechanisms of that design, while being a bit more complex, dynamic, interactive, rich, tense, and mean.\n>\n> The game features a main board shared by both opponents, card powers, and three victory conditions.\n\n![Splendor Duel game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V1PyFDPNFY4bJFgreLPxmQ__itemrep/img/X1a_aOpNwx26n4NuXIK3RDvP7hY=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6929347.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.\n>\n> In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n![Azul game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aPSHJO0d0XOpQR5X-wJonw__itemrep/img/6oRLPDvy4zz3gOZM6e6NzIk8Seg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6973671.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans — whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.\n>\n> In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.\n\n![Azul: Summer Pavilion game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/843kZ6WR0HfyXWEybA6L7A__itemrep/img/zOE89_4aCHOqoYITnbMSxAVR_UA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic4930887.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons — the currency/points in the game — and someone is chosen as the start player.\n>\n> On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\n\n![Patchwork game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLW7pFn0--20lEizEz5p3A__itemrep/img/rJ1GPoOG_t9d3H2mnfROcR5OhNQ=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2270442.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

As a cartographer in her service, you are sent to map this territory, claiming it for the Kingdom of Nalos. Through official edicts, the queen announces which lands she prizes most, and you will increase your reputation by meeting her demands. But you are not alone in this wilderness. The Dragul contest your claims with their outposts, so you must draw your lines carefully to reduce their influence. Reclaim the greatest share of the queen’s desired lands and you will be declared the greatest cartographer in the kingdom.\n>\n> In Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale, players compete to earn the most reputation stars by the time four seasons have passed. Each season, players draw on their map sheets and earn reputation by carrying out the queen's edicts before the season is over.

On a turn, you flip cards from three stacks to create three different combinations of a starship number and a corresponding action, then all players choose one of these three combinations. You use the number to fill a space in a zone on your adventure sheet in numerical order, and everyone is racing to be the first to complete common missions.\n>\n> The eight adventure sheets feature very different mechanisms from the classic concept, and when you play in campaign mode, you'll make choices that change the next adventure, which means that each campaign will differ from the previous one.\n\n![Welcome to the Moon game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eCdiHCB9OobumwaGl4dbOQ__itemrep/img/S8KJaJ1UfomzoC4XGob6pIkresI=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic6204967.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Ragnarök has come, and it’s the end of the world! It’s the Vikings’ last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin’s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarök, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n> Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These “Gods’ Gifts” grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.\n\n![Blood Rage game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__itemrep/img/ZSJhCapvtPoiIQZ1XdfO-qgUuFY=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic2439223.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Western histories often call this period \"The Great Game\" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\n> In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game.

Released in 1983, it broke away from the traditional requirement of two players by allowing a solo player to engage in man-to-man combat scenarios. What made Ambush! unique was its use of tables, charts, and a \"paragraph book\" to control the opponent's actions, eliminating the need for an opposing player. This approach kept the enemy hidden until they became visible through gameplay, enhancing the element of surprise and realism. While it allowed for multiple players to participate by controlling different squads or soldiers, the complexity of scenario creation often required players to purchase expansion modules. Ambush! is a strategy game that offers an engaging and challenging experience for players seeking tactical warfare simulations.\n\n![Ambush!](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8H-hiPuWsdD07fcj0kMsYA__itemrep/img/lrnLlctpbFXS7Sz_MnZu-SveGoE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\\(\\)/pic265524.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n> The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n> Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains.

Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n> It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals.

Everything goes well at the beginning when they calmly agree on the same amount of candies for each of them, but soon they come up with more and more ideas and a debate starts… the Pig says,“Those who weigh over 10kg should get an extra candy!”... the Dog says, “Whoever oversleeps should return a candy to the pool!” To resolve their hectic argument, they finally decide to form the House of Pets, at which the animal councilors will discuss proposals and vote on new laws. Who can get the most delicious candies in this exciting voting game? Based on Karl-Heinz Schmiel's Das Regeln Wir Schon, players attempt to pass laws which benefit themselves. The laws are either immediate or semi-permanent, and they can have all kinds of different effects: all players with beards get five points, vote cards must be played with the left hand, or some sort of re-evaluation or redistribution of the chips that each player has.

This new adventure takes your crew deep down into the abyss on a search for the fabled sunken land. How far you get depends entirely on how well you work together as a team. Card by card, trick by trick, your search party will discover the challenges that lie ahead and forge a path to Mu.</p>\n<p>This new version of The Crew has the same innovative co-operative trick-taking mechanism as the highly lauded original game — but with some exciting new surprises! While communication between your crew members is severely limited by your submerged state, it is also critical to your success; finding the hidden land in the murky depths depends not only on winning tricks, but also on carefully negotiating the order in which they are won. If things don't go as planned, you might just be able to salvage the operation, but it will take near flawless execution and perhaps a little luck to finally reach Mu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__itemrep/img/tgB3g7PECxG14yQ0FkMiMaXaOFE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic5988903.jpg\" alt=\"The Crew: Mission Deep Sea game image\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support.

In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\nIn terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game.

Players assume the roles of aristocrats seeking to expand their princedoms by building settlements, constructing formidable castles, engaging in river trade, exploiting silver mines, and harnessing the knowledge of travelers. The core gameplay revolves around selecting settlement tiles from the game board and placing them onto a personal player board, with each tile having a unique function. These tiles must be placed in regions that match their type. The game unfolds in five phases, each comprising five rounds. Players roll dice at the start of each round, with one player determining the availability of goods tiles. On their turns, players can perform two of four possible actions: taking settlement tiles from the game board, placing tiles on their player board, delivering goods, or obtaining worker tokens to adjust dice rolls. Bonus points are awarded for various accomplishments, and the game concludes after the fifth phase. Victory points are tallied, and the player with the most points emerges as the winner.

The objective is to develop, construct, and expand your industrial network to meet the high demand for iron, coal, and cotton. The game unfolds in two phases, the canal phase, and the rail phase, with victory points (VPs) being the ultimate goal. Players take turns, with each round offering two actions to choose from a set list, which includes building industries, constructing canals or rails, developing industries, selling cotton, or taking a loan. The turn order depends on the amount of money spent, creating strategic opportunities for those who go later in the order. After the canal phase, a scoring round occurs, followed by the rail phase with expanded building possibilities. After another scoring round, the game concludes, and the winner is determined. The game's unique card system dictates where industries can be built while allowing flexible use for other actions, encouraging strategic card management. Resources are shared, adding depth to competition, as players often rely on each other's production.

Released in 1983, it broke away from the traditional requirement of two players by allowing a solo player to engage in man-to-man combat scenarios. What made Ambush! unique was its use of tables, charts, and a \"paragraph book\" to control the opponent's actions, eliminating the need for an opposing player. This approach kept the enemy hidden until they became visible through gameplay, enhancing the element of surprise and realism. While it allowed for multiple players to participate by controlling different squads or soldiers, the complexity of scenario creation often required players to purchase expansion modules. Ambush! is a strategy game that offers an engaging and challenging experience for players seeking tactical warfare simulations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8H-hiPuWsdD07fcj0kMsYA__itemrep/img/lrnLlctpbFXS7Sz_MnZu-SveGoE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic265524.jpg\" alt=\"Ambush!\" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Players</th>\n<th>Min.

During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. Of a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.

Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave.
