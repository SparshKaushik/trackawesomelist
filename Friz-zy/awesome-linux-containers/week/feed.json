This means containers can use the same file system image as the base for the container. When a container writes content to the image, it gets written to a container specific file system. This prevents one container from seeing the changes of another container even if they wrote to the same file system image. Just as important, one container can not change the image content to effect the processes in another container.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>uid 0 -&gt; user namespaces, uid 0 mappet to random uid outside</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>system services like devices, network, filesystems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>kernel drivers, network stack, security policies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>general like immutable infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>container is ro</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>write to small separate rw nosuid part</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Security / Technologies for security</p>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>SELinux</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cgroups</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>file systems under /sys</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>/proc/sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/irq, /proc/bus</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>/dev/mem</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>/dev/sd* file system devices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>kernel modules</li>\n</ul>\n"
