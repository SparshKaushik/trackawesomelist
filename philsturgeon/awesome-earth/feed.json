For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels. We should tear down these dams as soon as possible, be that when their contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money operating them or trying to revive them.

Now a misguided plan to feed the starving whales with hatchery salmon will push both endangered species closer to the edge, while costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year.\nTell NOAA Regional Administrator Barry Thom, WDFW Director Kelly Susewind, and our elected decision makers to stop wasting money on failed plans and invest in science-based solutions: reduce hatchery production, remove dams and change how we harvest salmon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.change.org/t/dam-removal-en-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">US Damn Removal</a> - <a href=\"https://www.ussdams.org/our-news/americas-aging-dams-in-need-of-repair/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70 percent of the dams in the United States</a> are now more than 50 years old, with almost 2,000 of them rated as \"high-hazard\". About <a href=\"https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1,000 dams have failed</a> over the past four decades, killing 34 people, and now many are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate.\nWith dams causing wild salmon populations to go extinct, their only benefit is hydropower, yet dams are woefully inefficient by modern standards. For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels. We should tear down these dams as soon as possible, be that when their contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money operating them or trying to revive them. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpzvaqypav8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More on Last Week Tonight</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Reforestation</p>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.weforest.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeForest</a> - WeForest empowers communities to advance and implement innovative, high standard, scalable and lasting solutions to restore forest landscapes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Transportation</p>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bicycleuniverse.com/car-free-millionaire/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Biking vs. Driving Calculator</a> - Riding your bike can make you a millionaire!
