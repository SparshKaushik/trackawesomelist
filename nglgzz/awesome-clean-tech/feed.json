The goal is to bring the benefits of hydroponics (less water and land, more consistent yields), with a lower investment up front.\n*   [Solar Foods](https://solarfoods.fi/) | Finland | 2017\n\n    Produces Solein - a single-cell protein - from water, CO2 and electricity. It doesn’t require arable land or irrigation and isn’t limited by climate conditions. The original concept of Solein was born from a NASA space programme, and was further developed in the research projects of the Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd and the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT).\n\n### Companies / Materials\n\n*   [Cellugy](https://cellugy.com/) | Denmark | 2018\n\n    Offers a biomaterial produced from food and vegetable waste, that can be used for packaging as an alternative to plastic. This material is translucent, resistent, and home compostable.\n\n### Companies / Water\n\n*   [The Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/) | Netherlands | 2013\n\n    Developed a technology to passively collect ocean debris, with the goal of cleaning the oceans of 90% of their plastic waste by 2040. In 2018 they deployed their solution in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n*   [Orbital Systems](https://orbital-systems.com/) | Sweden | 2012\n\n    Collaborated with NASA to develop a shower system that uses 90% less water. The shower has a purification system that makes it possible to reuse the same batch of water. The company now wants to make this technology - initially developed for space - available to consumers.\n*   [Solar Water Solutions](https://solarwatersolutions.fi/en/) | Finland | 2015\n\n    Develops a reverse osmosis technology for producing drinking water with low operating expenses and no CO2 emissions. The desalination system is fully solar, independent of external energy sources and easy-to-use and maintain.\n\n### Companies / Energy\n\n*   [Solar City](https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels) | California, USA | 2006\n\n    Current products include a solar panel roof that collects as much power as possible without looking like a solar panel, and Powerwall, a home energy storage solution.\n\n### Companies / Social Impact\n\n*   [Ducky](https://www.ducky.eco/en/) | Norway | 2014\n\n    Offers a range of products based on climate and environmental research data, where you can monitor your personal footprint in their climate calculator, learn about climate psychology, and reduce carbon emissions through friendly team competitions.",
