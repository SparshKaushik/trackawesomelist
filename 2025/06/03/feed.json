Compression is at the heart of intelligence. A theoretically optimal way to compress any sequence of data is to find the shortest program that outputs that sequence and then halts. However, such Kolmogorov compression is uncomputable, and code generating LLMs struggle to approximate this theoretical ideal, as it requires reasoning, planning and search capabilities beyond those of current models. This work introduces the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence intelligence test for code generation LLMs. In KT a model is presented with a sequence of data at inference time, and asked to generate the shortest DSL (designed specifically for the task) program that produces the sequence. The authors identify several benefits of KT for both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem instances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already exist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining data contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, the authors use audio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic DSL programs.",
