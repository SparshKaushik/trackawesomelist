Balancing sufficient yield in the present with necessary investment in the future; 4. Shaping the values and standards of the organization.”\n*   [How CEOs Manage Time](https://archive.ph/S32wu) - A study on what CEO of large companies spent their time on, and how. Opens a new window into what leadership is all about and into its many components and dimensions.\n*   [Operations and Internal Communication Strategies For Effective CEOs](https://archive.ph/9DkfA) - After insisting on the importance of context and narratives, the author provide an interesting template (good for inspiration) of ritual and recurring internal communication devices.\n*   “Hiring isn't the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.” ([source](https://x.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).\n\n### Roles / CTO & VP of Engineering\n\n*   [Hiring a VP of Engineering? Use This Framework](https://review.firstround.com/hiring-a-vp-of-engineering-use-this-framework-from-shopifys-vpe-to-get-it-right/) - “*How do I hire a VP of Engineering?* After more than 20 years, eight companies, and thousands of hires, I'm starting to suspect this may be the wrong question. A better one is, *What is a VP of Engineering?*”\n\n### Roles / Engineering Managers\n\n*   [Identify what makes a great manager](https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager#learn-about-googles-manager-research) - Google tried to prove managers don't matter. Instead, it discovered [10 Traits of the Very Best Ones](https://archive.ph/1USa4).\n*   [As a product manager, how do you earn the respect and trust of your team?](https://web.archive.org/web/20220115172555/https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1124938723093766144)\n*   [Great PMs don't spend their time on solutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20250511211605/https://www.intercom.com/blog/great-product-managers-dont-spend-time-on-solutions/) - Not on solutions, no. But on customer's problems.\n\n### Roles / Engineers\n\n*   [Devs I really enjoy pairing with](https://x.com/ScribblingOn/status/1002598672444448768) - “Don't act like know-it-all; Openly admit if they don't know something; Try to figure stuff out together”.\n\n### Motivation / Negotiation\n\n*   Reflecting on the postulates above, [Bryan Cantrill defines that the role of management](https://x.com/bcantrill/status/1216491615264489473?s=20) “is in constructing that environment, not micromanaging it. If engineering performance is suffering, it's (likely) a management problem: wrong problem, wrong mission, or wrong team -- or all three.”\n\n### Motivation / Happiness\n\n*   “My team tracks life impact as a metric (pages outside business hours) and works to drive that down to zero.” ([source](https://x.com/dwc/status/962179099606200320)) - Maybe the best indicator of a happy team is how little it is disturbed outside office hours.\n\n### Culture / Procrastination\n\n*   [It's Not Enough to Be Right—You Also Have to Be Kind](https://archive.ph/RoW6v) - “It's harder to be kind than clever”, or put another way by Abraham Joshua Heschel: “When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire kind people.”\n\n### Cognitive Tools / Problem Solving\n\n*   [The Art of Powerful Questions - Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action](https://www.betterevaluation.org/sites/default/files/the-art-of-powerful-questions.pdf) - “Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for fostering breakthrough thinking.”\n\n### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral\n\n*   “People make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed.” - [Disney's Frozen](https://web.archive.org/web/20250123004447if_/https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/17/97/b5179700050b96f91f63e086e053b5ee.jpg).\n\n### Team Dynamics / Behavioral\n\n*   [How to Celebrate the Small Wins](https://web.archive.org/web/20190714235605/https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-celebrate-the-small-wins-4a03004a1816?gi=90c401bc3fd1) - My takeaway: “Celebrating Slow Progress; Hunt for Key Milestones”.\n\n### Engineering / The Technical Engineering Manager\n\n*   [If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work](https://archive.ph/J2vlo#selection-1025.8-1025.64) - “Although we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work – type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance – they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.”\n\n### Engineering / Technology\n\n*   “Software development is more akin to the product design and development phase of industrial production than to the manufacturing.” ([source](https://accu.org/bookreviews/1998/kloss_1668/)) - This quote is from a review of [*Superdistribution - Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201502089?\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=dc65849a678d52afa9f3685159673d6e\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), in which the creator of Objective-C was advocating in the 90's for a new economic framework that rewards creation of components in proportion to their use. But software production is not like manufacturing of widgets in a factory. [A (software) object is not an (hardware) widget](https://x.com/kdeldycke/status/1697974273623675254).\n\n### Engineering / Technical Debt\n\n*   [Technical Debt Is Like Tetris](https://web.archive.org/web/20190313164624/https://medium.com/@erichiggins/technical-debt-is-like-tetris-168f64d8b700) - Another way to explain technical debt: “Scenarios like these create technical debt within the product code. A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (…) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.”\n*   [Technical debt as a lack of understanding](https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/) - “The problem lies in \"never reorganizing \\[the code] to reflect your understanding.\" (…) Organizationally, you pay in velocity and turnover; talented people are going to leave after a few rounds of bullshit.”\n\n### Remote Work / Technical Debt\n\n*   [Asynchronous Communication: The Real Reason Remote Workers Are More Productive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250506052542/https://async.twist.com/asynchronous-communication/) - “Remote workers are more productive than their office-bound counterparts.”\n\n### Meetings / Technical Debt\n\n*   [Dear Manager, You're Holding Too Many Meetings](https://archive.ph/1P4FQ) - “Employee productivity was 71% higher when meetings were reduced by 40%. This is largely because employees felt more empowered and autonomous. Rather than a schedule being the boss, they owned their to-do lists and held themselves accountable.”\n\n### Product Management / Standups\n\n*   [Things Many People Find Too Obvious To Have Told You Already](https://archive.ph/vH4D1) - A set of heuristics on tech companies and the ecosystem they live in.\n*   [Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20250528080513/https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html) - Lots of wisdom about space program management.\n\n### Product Management / Product Strategy\n\n*   [“Why does the tire company rate restaurants”](https://mobile.x.com/trevmckendrick/status/1218748974321954816) - A great example on why you should investigate complementary businesses.\n*   Windows Vista as a prime example of a [sacrificial lamb product](https://x.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/851861076429991937): a massive unpopular re-architecture required to pave the way for future innovative release.

Collect requirement lists from customers and prospective customers; 2. Make sure their product checks every damn box, no matter how stupid.”\n*   “Linear roadmaps are misleading” ([source](https://x.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1296818042928861184)).\n\n### Product Management / Product Marketing\n\n*   [How the biggest consumer apps got their first 1,000 users](https://archive.ph/DggAq) - How the biggest apps out there started: from going to your user directly (both online and offline), creating FOMO and word-of-mouth, to build a community first and get press.\n\n### Project Management / Estimations\n\n*   [Who are you trying to impress with your deadlines?](https://archive.ph/9Hq7N) - “There are companies where those deadlines are set in stone, and a missed deadline is next to fire. That's when the problem starts.”\n*   [Robert \"Uncle Bob\" Martin talk about professionalism in software development](https://youtu.be/LmRl0D-RkPU?t=3202) - The only honest estimate is \"I don't know\". But you can come up with some kind of probability assessment, that will inform about the shape of the risk. This is not unlike PERT, where an activity is bounded by [optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique#Time). Now if managers don't take a range for an answer, don't fall in that trap. Tell them you're already trying as you possibly can. “And then the manager will have to do something very foreign: they'll have to manage. That's what management is: managing risk.”\n\n### Agile / Delivery\n\n*   [Why do some developers at Google consider Agile development to be nonsense?](https://archive.ph/pSUhM) - Because the short-term focused Scrum processes “seem suited to particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs the show because they are paying for development, and can change their mind at any time”. Still, google engineers already practice a culture close to what looks like the original 10-points Agile manifesto. But that's it.\n*   [Story Points Revisited](https://web.archive.org/web/20250604004212/https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/story-points/Index.html) - The alleged inventor of story points says they are probably a mistake.\n*   [Detecting Agile Bullshit](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601171312/https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF) - US Department of Defense guide to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (“agile-scrum-fall”).\n\n### Objectives and Key Results (OKR) / Delivery\n\n*   [OKRs from a development team's perspective](https://archive.ph/dmASK) - On how OKRs articulates with a backlog.\n*   [Why individual OKRs don't work for us](https://web.archive.org/web/20250218070530/https://hrblog.spotify.com/2016/08/15/our-beliefs) - Spotify decision to stop using OKRs for individuals.\n\n### Communication / Writing\n\n*   [The Baldwin Formula for scientific writing: writing papers and reviews](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/jlichstein/files/Baldwin_Formula_for_writing_a_scientific_paper_and_reviewing_papers.pdf) - “The most efficient way to write scientific papers is to write while you are still conducting experiments”.\n\n### Career / Presentations\n\n*   [How title, money and scope affect your fulfillment](https://x.com/shreyas/status/1268372416427786240) - “For talented mid-career folks, when making job changes, how do you rank: 1.
