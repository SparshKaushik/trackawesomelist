If engineering performance is suffering, it's (likely) a management problem: wrong problem, wrong mission, or wrong team -- or all three.”\n\n### Motivation / Happiness\n\n*   “My team tracks life impact as a metric (pages outside business hours) and works to drive that down to zero.” ([source](https://x.com/dwc/status/962179099606200320)) - Maybe the best indicator of a happy team is how little it is disturbed outside office hours.\n\n### Culture / Procrastination\n\n*   [It's Not Enough to Be Right—You Also Have to Be Kind](https://archive.ph/RoW6v) - “It's harder to be kind than clever”, or put another way by Abraham Joshua Heschel: “When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire kind people.”\n\n### Cognitive Tools / Problem Solving\n\n*   [The Art of Powerful Questions - Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action](https://www.betterevaluation.org/sites/default/files/the-art-of-powerful-questions.pdf) - “Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for fostering breakthrough thinking.”\n\n### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral\n\n*   “People make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed.” - [Disney's Frozen](https://web.archive.org/web/20250123004447if_/https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/17/97/b5179700050b96f91f63e086e053b5ee.jpg).\n\n### Team Dynamics / Behavioral\n\n*   [How to Celebrate the Small Wins](https://web.archive.org/web/20190714235605/https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-celebrate-the-small-wins-4a03004a1816?gi=90c401bc3fd1) - My takeaway: “Celebrating Slow Progress; Hunt for Key Milestones”.\n\n### Engineering / The Technical Engineering Manager\n\n*   [If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work](https://archive.ph/J2vlo#selection-1025.8-1025.64) - “Although we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work – type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance – they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.”\n\n### Engineering / Technology\n\n*   “Software development is more akin to the product design and development phase of industrial production than to the manufacturing.” ([source](https://accu.org/bookreviews/1998/kloss_1668/)) - This quote is from a review of [*Superdistribution - Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201502089?\\&linkCode=ll1\\&tag=kevideld-20\\&linkId=dc65849a678d52afa9f3685159673d6e\\&language=en_US\\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), in which the creator of Objective-C was advocating in the 90's for a new economic framework that rewards creation of components in proportion to their use.

That's when the problem starts.”\n*   [Robert \"Uncle Bob\" Martin talk about professionalism in software development](https://youtu.be/LmRl0D-RkPU?t=3202) - The only honest estimate is \"I don't know\". But you can come up with some kind of probability assessment, that will inform about the shape of the risk. This is not unlike PERT, where an activity is bounded by [optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique#Time). Now if managers don't take a range for an answer, don't fall in that trap.

That's what management is: managing risk.”\n\n### Agile / Delivery\n\n*   [Why do some developers at Google consider Agile development to be nonsense?](https://archive.ph/pSUhM) - Because the short-term focused Scrum processes “seem suited to particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs the show because they are paying for development, and can change their mind at any time”.

Domain-Specific Aspect Languages (DSALs) are Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) designed to express crosscutting concerns. Compared to DSLs, their aspectual nature greatly amplifies the language design space. This survey structures this space in order to shed light on and compare the different domain-specific approaches to deal with crosscutting concerns. This survey reports on a corpus of 36 DSALs covering the space, discuss a set of design considerations, and provide a taxonomy of DSAL implementation approaches. This work serves as a frame of reference to DSAL and DSL researchers, enabling further advances in the field, and to developers as a guide for DSAL implementations.\n*   [No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9904438) - ***IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics***, 2022. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17206818917381447796)]. There has been substantial growth in the use of JSON-based grammars, as well as other standard data serialization languages, to create visualizations. Each of these grammars serves a purpose: some focus on particular computational tasks (such as animation), some are concerned with certain chart types (such as maps), and some target specific data domains (such as ML). Despite the prominence of this interface form, there has been little detailed analysis of the characteristics of these languages. This study surveys and analyzes the design and implementation of 57 JSON-style DSLs for visualization. The authors analyze these languages supported by a collected corpus of examples for each DSL (consisting of 4395 instances) across a variety of axes organized into concerns related to domain, conceptual model, language relationships, affordances, and general practicalities. The authors identify tensions throughout these areas, such as between formal and colloquial specifications, among types of users, and within the composition of languages. Through this work, the authors seek to support language implementers by elucidating the choices, opportunities, and tradeoffs in visualization DSL design.\n*   [Reproducibility in automated chemistry laboratories using computer science abstractions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-024-00649-8) - ***Nature Synthesis***, 2024. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2583939834455194329)]. While abstraction is critical for the transferability of automated laboratory science in (bio)chemical and materials sciences, its improper implementation is a technical debt taken against the reproducibility of experimental results. Over the decades, computer science has developed guidelines and strategies for how abstractions are captured in programming languages---particularly concerning the substitutability of implementations of abstracted ideas and the clear definition of the contexts in which abstractions are used. However, few programming languages developed for automated experiments fully leverage the wisdom learned in computer science. To achieve collaborative sharing of scientific knowledge via automated laboratories, the way that experimental protocols are codified and interpreted by machine agents must use abstractions responsibly and with reproducibility, rather than solely transferability, at its core. This Review discusses how computer science principles of abstraction can be translated to create more reproducible automation as an enabler for the acceleration of collaborative research with self-driving laboratories.\n\n### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications\n\n*   [Genetic circuit design automation with Cello 2.0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00675-2) - ***Nature Protocol***, 2022. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7418307542591684967)]. \\[[Preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel-Oliveira-38/publication/358801979_Genetic_circuit_design_automation_with_Cello_20/links/635debf412cbac6a3e0b19e4/Genetic-circuit-design-automation-with-Cello-20.pdf)]. Cells interact with their environment, communicate among themselves, track time and make decisions through functions controlled by natural regulatory genetic circuits consisting of interacting biological components. Synthetic programmable circuits used in therapeutics and other applications can be automatically designed by computer-aided tools. The Cello software designs the DNA sequences for programmable circuits based on a high-level software description and a library of characterized DNA parts representing Boolean logic gates. This process allows for design specification reuse, modular DNA part library curation and formalized circuit transformations based on experimental data. This protocol describes Cello 2.0, a freely available cross-platform software written in Java. Cello 2.0 enables flexible descriptions of the logic gates’ structure and their mathematical models representing dynamic behavior, new formal rules for describing the placement of gates in a genome, a new graphical user interface, support for Verilog 2005 syntax and a connection to the SynBioHub parts repository software environment. Collectively, these features expand Cello’s capabilities beyond Escherichia coli plasmids to new organisms and broader genetic contexts, including the genome. Designing circuits with Cello 2.0 produces an abstract Boolean network from a Verilog file, assigns biological parts to each node in the Boolean network, constructs a DNA sequence and generates highly structured and annotated sequence representations suitable for downstream processing and fabrication, respectively. The result is a sequence implementing the specified Boolean function in the organism and predictions of circuit performance. Depending on the size of the design space and users’ expertise, jobs may take minutes or hours to complete.\n*   [MoVer: Motion Verification for Motion Graphics Animations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13372) - ***ACM Transactions on Graphics***, 2025. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=527747131334466686)]. While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all of spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. This work introduces MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. The authors identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). The authors implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. The authors then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, the pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation.\n*   [The KoLMogorov Test: Compression by Code Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=C45YqeBDUM) - ***ICLR'25***, 2025. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16809888292456252135)]. Compression is at the heart of intelligence. A theoretically optimal way to compress any sequence of data is to find the shortest program that outputs that sequence and then halts. However, such Kolmogorov compression is uncomputable, and code generating LLMs struggle to approximate this theoretical ideal, as it requires reasoning, planning and search capabilities beyond those of current models. This work introduces the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence intelligence test for code generation LLMs. In KT a model is presented with a sequence of data at inference time, and asked to generate the shortest DSL (designed specifically for the task) program that produces the sequence. The authors identify several benefits of KT for both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem instances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already exist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining data contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, the authors use audio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic DSL programs.\n\n### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research\n\n*   [ChipNeMo: Domain-Adapted LLMs for Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176) - 2023. \\[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5962372610489019326)]. ChipNeMo aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design. Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs, the authors instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques: domain-adaptive tokenization, domain-adaptive continued pretraining, model alignment with domain-specific instructions, and domain-adapted retrieval models. The authors evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis. Evaluations demonstrate that domain-adaptive pretraining of language models, can lead to superior performance in domain related downstream tasks compared to their base LLaMA2 counterparts, without degradations in generic capabilities. In particular, the largest model, ChipNeMo-70B, outperforms the highly capable GPT-4 on two of the use cases, namely engineering assistant chatbot and EDA scripts generation, while exhibiting competitive performance on bug summarization and analysis. These results underscore the potential of domain-specific customization for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models in specialized applications.",

[<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16809888292456252135\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. Compression is at the heart of intelligence. A theoretically optimal way to compress any sequence of data is to find the shortest program that outputs that sequence and then halts. However, such Kolmogorov compression is uncomputable, and code generating LLMs struggle to approximate this theoretical ideal, as it requires reasoning, planning and search capabilities beyond those of current models. This work introduces the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence intelligence test for code generation LLMs. In KT a model is presented with a sequence of data at inference time, and asked to generate the shortest DSL (designed specifically for the task) program that produces the sequence. The authors identify several benefits of KT for both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem instances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already exist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining data contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, the authors use audio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic DSL programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><p>Science Logology / AI Assisted Research</p>\n</h3><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChipNeMo: Domain-Adapted LLMs for Chip Design</a> - 2023. [<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5962372610489019326\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Versions</a>]. ChipNeMo aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design. Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs, the authors instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques: domain-adaptive tokenization, domain-adaptive continued pretraining, model alignment with domain-specific instructions, and domain-adapted retrieval models. The authors evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis. Evaluations demonstrate that domain-adaptive pretraining of language models, can lead to superior performance in domain related downstream tasks compared to their base LLaMA2 counterparts, without degradations in generic capabilities. In particular, the largest model, ChipNeMo-70B, outperforms the highly capable GPT-4 on two of the use cases, namely engineering assistant chatbot and EDA scripts generation, while exhibiting competitive performance on bug summarization and analysis. These results underscore the potential of domain-specific customization for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models in specialized applications.</li>\n</ul>\n",
