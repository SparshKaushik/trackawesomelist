One fundamental property of natural image data that distinguishes vision from other sensory tasks such as speech recognition is that scale plays a profound role in image formation and interpretation. Specifically, visual objects can appear at a wide range of scales in the images due to the change of viewing distance as well as camera resolution. The same objects appearing at different scales produce different image data with different statistical properties. In particular, this work shows that the entropy rate of the image data changes over scale. Moreover, the inferential uncertainty changes over scale too. The authors call these changes information scaling. They then examine both empirically and theoretically two prominent and yet largely isolated classes of image models, namely, wavelet sparse coding models and Markov random field models. The results indicate that the two classes of models are appropriate for two different entropy regimes: sparse coding targets low entropy regimes, whereas Markov random fields are appropriate for high entropy regimes. Because information scaling connects different entropy regimes, both sparse coding and Markov random fields are necessary for representing natural image data, and information scaling triggers transitions between these two regimes.",
