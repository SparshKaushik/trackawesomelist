What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and your honeypot. If you deployed an SSH server on Bifrozt’s internal network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You would not have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work. It will limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop outbound packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded.\n\n### Endpoint / Mobile / Android / iOS\n\n*   [SecMobi Wiki](http://wiki.secmobi.com/) - A collection of mobile security resources which including articles, blogs, books, groups, projects, tools and conferences. \\*\n\n### Threat Intelligence / Forensics\n\n*   [abuse.ch](https://www.abuse.ch/) - ZeuS Tracker / SpyEye Tracker / Palevo Tracker / Feodo Tracker tracks Command\\&Control servers (hosts) around the world and provides you a domain- and an IP-blocklist.\n*   [SBL / XBL / PBL / DBL / DROP / ROKSO](http://www.spamhaus.org/) - The Spamhaus Project is an international nonprofit organization whose mission is to track the Internet's spam operations and sources, to provide dependable realtime anti-spam protection for Internet networks, to work with Law Enforcement Agencies to identify and pursue spam and malware gangs worldwide, and to lobby governments for effective anti-spam legislation.\n\n### Web / Web Application Firewall\n\n*   [ModSecurity](http://www.modsecurity.org/) - ModSecurity is a toolkit for real-time web application monitoring, logging, and access control.\n*   [NAXSI (⭐4.8k)](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi) - NAXSI is an open-source, high performance, low rules maintenance WAF for NGINX, NAXSI means Nginx Anti Xss & Sql Injection.\n\n### Web / Scanning / Pentesting\n\n*   [ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) - The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
