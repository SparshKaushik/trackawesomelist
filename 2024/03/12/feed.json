The review focuses on how cognitive science can provide forward models of human decision-making and inverse models of how humans think about others’ decision-making. The authors highlight relevant recent developments, including approaches that synthesize black box and theory-driven modeling, accounts that recast heuristics and biases as forms of bounded optimality, and models that characterize human theory of mind and communication in decision-theoretic terms.",
