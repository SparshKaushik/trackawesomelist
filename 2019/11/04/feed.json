It is released in a single portable implementation that can be easily cross-compiled on many systems like ATtiny, ATmega, ESP8266, Teensy, Raspberry Pi, Windows X86, Apple and Android. It is a valid tool to quickly build a network of devices.\n\n### Uncategorised\n\n*   [PirateBox](https://daviddarts.com/piratebox) is a self-contained mobile communication and file sharing device. Simply turn it on to transform any space into a free and open communications and file sharing network.\n\n### Dead\n\n*   [Airlock (⭐44)](https://github.com/slothbag/Airlock) A decentralized dropbox / mega upload style app.  Uses a combination of Ethereum and IPFS to index and list content\n*   [Cactus player](https://bitbucket.org/cactusplayer/cactusplayer/src/master/) Decentralized P2P Music Player - main site has gone, but linking to source in case someone wants to know how it worked.\n*   [ClearSkies (⭐1.4k)](https://github.com/jewel/clearskies) is a peer-to-peer file sync program.  It is inspired by BitTorrent Sync, but has an open and fully-documented protocol.\n*   [G0Bin (⭐84)](https://github.com/jyap808/g0bin) is a client side encrypted pastebin written in Go. The server has zero knowledge of pasted data. Data is encrypted/decrypted in the browser using 256 bits AES.\n*   [Grand Decentral Station](http://decentralize.it) is a concept for a server OS that enables designers and developers to build beautiful and secure self-hosted applications for everyone.\n*   [OpenBazaar](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar) is a decentralized marketplace proof of concept. It is based off of the POC code by the darkmarket team and is now licensed under the MIT license.\n*   [Syme](https://getsyme.com) is an experimental project that aims at bringing more privacy and security to online communication through end-to-end encryption. Syme's zero-knowledge key infrastructure enables persistent multiparty communication and secure key exchanges on minimally trusted servers and relays.\n*   [BitPhone](http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/projects/bitphone/) is a mobile communications device with the features of a modern smartphone built on top of decentralized BitCoin-style proof-of-work networking.\n*   [Coinpunk](http://coinpunk.org/) is a web application that allows anyone to run their own self-hosted Bitcoin wallet service that is accessible from your web browser anywhere in the world. It's free, open source, and you can install it on your server right now.\n*   [CryptAByte](https://cryptabyte.com/) CryptAByte.com is a free online drop box that enables secure (encrypted) message and file sharing over the web using a public-key infrastructure. Messages and files are encrypted using a public key and can only be decrypted using the passphrase entered when your key is created. Your data is never stored in plaintext, and is impossible to decrypt without your passphrase.\n*   [DAppStore](http://dappstore.dappcentral.com/) is a fully decentralized App store focussing entirely on decentralized software.  Primarily to index DApps like Bitcoin, BitTorrent etc, but also indexes projects relating to DApps, wether that be a documentary, software library or coffee shop that supports a particular DApp.\n*   The [Enigmabox](http://wiki.enigmabox.net/) is a ready to use cjdns appliance. cjdns is a public-key crypto network protocol, the fingerprint is your IPv6 address. This means, your IP is your identity. So we can use it for various useful things, e.g. as an email address or a phone number. We will start preparing existing internet services like email or VoIP to use cjdns in this decentral manner. Our goal is to encrypt the entire internet, make crypto accessible and make secure and decentralized internet services available for the rest of us.\n*   [Firecloud](http://firecloud.co) is a P2P web publishing platform in your using Persona and WebRTC to work its magic.\n*   [Lemon.email](https://lemon.email/) is encrypted and decentralized e-mail service. It can be totally decentralized (works as a [dApp](https://ipfs.io/ipns/dapp.lemon.email/)) or it can work as a mail service that uses IPFS/Ethereum as a storage for previously encrypted emails. The way encryption works is that the passphrase that is used to unlock emails is not saved anywhere and therefore nobody cannot read user’s emails. Also, third party email services cannot read or decrypt lemon emails, because only notification about incoming email is sent to those services and user must go to external link to read private email.\n*   [Lighthouse](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse) is a peer to peer crowdfunding app that uses Bitcoin.\n*   The [Refuge Project](http://refuge.io/) aims to provide a fully decentralized and opensource data platform. It is built in Erlang and includes [RCouch (⭐67)](https://github.com/refuge/rcouch), a static distribution of couchdb using rebar, and [Coffer (⭐22)](https://github.com/refuge/coffer), a blob server.\n*   [Tavern](https://tavern.com/) is a distributed, anonymous, unblockable network designed to ensure that no one is silenced, censored, or cut off from the rest of the world",
