Inspired by the events of their day—like the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and growing public concern for the environment—they came together to form Oceanic Society, the first non-profit organization in America dedicated to marine conservation. Their aim was to bring greater public awareness and political action to issues of ocean health and to grow the global community of people working toward improved ocean stewardship. Oceanic Society helped put ocean conservation on the public radar. Some of our many accomplishments include: Creating the Oceanic Society Patrol and Farallon Patrol, pioneering ecotourism and volunteer vacations, inspiring a generation of ocean lovers through Oceans magazine, Leading the way in whale watching, strengthening local sea turtle conservation, globally and innovating a focus on behavior change.",
